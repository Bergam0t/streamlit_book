# Exercise 7: Take Me To The Clouds Above

The final task of the day is deploying an app.

- Create a new repository and upload one of the apps youâ€™ve created in the last few sessions to Github using the skills from session 7A (or borrow the sample app from the exercise_4 folder)

- Deploy your app to the streamlit community cloud
    - Remember to include a requirements.txt file

- Share your link in your PSG channel

If you finish this,

- Try uploading some more apps
- Go back to any exercises you want to spend more time on
- Or start building an app of your choice!
