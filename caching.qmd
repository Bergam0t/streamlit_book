We often want to load data files into Streamlit.

There are two main issues we might run into

1. Each time you rerun something in your app (e.g. filtering the dataframe by using a drop-down select box), then the code to load the dataframe gets run again too.
This can make your app feel really sluggish with larger data files


2. When we reach the stage of deploying our app to the web, we have to be a bit more conscious of how much memory our app is using when being accessed by multiple people simultaneously
By default, the data will be loaded in separately for each user - even though it’s identical
This can quickly lead to memory requirements ballooning (and your app crashing!)

By using the `@st.cache_data` decorator, Streamlit will intelligently handle the loading in of datasets to minimize unnecessary reloads and memory use.

To switch from doing a standard data import to using caching, we
- Turn our data import into a function that returns the data
- Add the @st.cache_data decorator directly above the function
- Call the function in our code to load the data in, assigning the output (the dataframe) to a variable

We can then just use our dataframe like normal - Streamlit will handle the awkward bits.

Caching can also be used for other large files - for example, if you wanted to load in a trained machine learning model that’s the same for all users who will interact with your app.

It’s not always obvious which to use, so head to [the Streamlit documentation](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/architecture/caching#deciding-which-caching-decorator-to-use) if you’re a bit unsure.


## Caching functions with parameters

While using caching for the initial load of a dataframe, it can also make sense to use it for other long-running functions.

Like normal functions, functions for caching can accept parameters.

Streamlit will be able to look at the parameters passed in and tell whether it should

use a cached version of the data (because the parameters are the same as a previous instance that’s already in its cache)

run the function (because it’s a new set of parameters that it doesn’t already have a saved output for in its cache)

* There are a few complexities around parameters that you may want to look into if using this in your own app: https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/architecture/caching#excluding-input-parameters
