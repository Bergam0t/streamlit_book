# Preface {.unnumbered}

Welcome to this book accompanying the Streamlit sessions of module 7 of the HSMA programme.

In this module we introduce the Streamlit framework for web app development.

Streamlit is a popular Python web framework that allows powerful and professional looking data apps to be created in hours instead of weeks.

In this book, we will introduce some of the key features of Streamlit and how to start putting them together to make more complex apps.


## stlite

Many examples throughout this book use the stlite framework and the stlite-quarto extension, which allows running of streamlit apps directly on the browser of the reader rather than hosting each app remotely.

This does mean that the app examples within each page do take a while to load, and you may not want to read this book cover-to-cover if you are on, say, a mobile network - each example will load several megabytes of data to be able to render.
