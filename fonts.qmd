To customise the look of your app much more than this, we need to turn to custom css.

CSS stands for ‘cascading style sheets’ and is a language used for theming much of the web!

We can create our own .css file and force Streamlit to load it in.

To load the file into the app, we need to include the following command:

```{python}
#| eval: false
with open("style.css") as css:
    st.markdown(f'<style>{css.read()}</style>', unsafe_allow_html=True)
```

This points towards the css file and wrapss it in some HTML tags that will ensure the css is recognised by the web browser.

The css file can contain any valid css, but we are interested in this chapter in targeting fonts specifically.

To begin with, we load in a font from the Google font families.

We then choose some areas of this app to apply it to.

`h1, h2, h3, h4, p` will target all headers and the main body text in the app.

More advanced or Streamlit-specific elements may be harder to target.

```{css}
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Lexend:wght@200&display=swap');

html, body, st-emotion-cache [class*="css"] {
    font-family: 'Lexend', sans-serif;
    font-size: 18px;
    font-weight: 200;
    color: #091747;
}

h1, h2, h3, h4, p {
	font-family: "Lexend", sans-serif;
}
```

You can right click when running your app and choose 'inspect' to get an idea of the possible tags to target with your custom CSS.

The streamlit forums and StackOverflow are also good ways to find examples of people applying custom theming to similar things to what you are looking to do.

Here is an example of a Streamlit title with and without the custom theming applied.

Google fonts provide a good option that is easy to load in via the method above.

You can explore the wide range of fonts offered here:

<https://fonts.google.com/>

**Istok Web** is often cited as being the closest Google Font equivalent to the standard NHS font *Frutiger*.

To apply this, you would use

```{css}
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Istok+Web:wght@200&display=swap');

html, body, st-emotion-cache [class*="css"] {
    font-family: 'Istok Web', sans-serif;
    font-size: 18px;
    font-weight: 200;
    color: #091747;
}

h1, h2, h3, h4, p {
	font-family: "Istok Web", sans-serif;
}
```
