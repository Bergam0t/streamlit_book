As your apps become more complex, you are likely to find yourself wanting to split the app across multiple pages.

:::{.callout-tip}
As Streamlit has evolved, this has become a native part of the framework.

In the early days of Streamlit, people came up with various creative workarounds, so you are likely to still encounter these when searching for information relating to multi-page apps in Streamlit on the web.

Information prior to 2022 is likely to be from before Streamlit supported this natively, so is not likely to be as relevant.

## Method 2: 'pages' subfolder

One other common way to deal with multipage apps is to have a `.py` file that is designed to be your main homepage, with all other pages being stored within a 'pages' subfolder.

:::{.callout-warning}
The subfolder **has** to be called *pages* to be picked up! You cannot rename it to something else.

Let's look at an example multipage app with 5 pages.

```{=html}
<iframe width="1100" height="800" src="https://penguin-trends-multipage-example-method-2.streamlit.app?embed=True" title="Quarto Components"></iframe>
```

The structure of our app in our filesystem looks like this.



In Windows explorer, this is how the files and folders appear.
