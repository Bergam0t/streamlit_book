The divider is a simple function that puts a horizontal line across the width of the page.

This can make it easier to indicate different sections of the page that should be looked at together.

```{python}
import streamlit as st

st.title("This is a title")

st.write("Here's a first line of text")

st.divider()

st.write("Here's some more text")

st.divider()

st.write("Here's the final text")

```

```{stlite-python}
import streamlit as st

st.title("This is a title")

st.write("Here's a first line of text")

st.divider()

st.write("Here's some more text")

st.write("And an extra line - you can put as many things as you want between each divider")

st.divider()

st.write("Here's the final text - though you don't have to have anything after the final divider if you don't want to (though arguably it's not necessary in that case!)")

```

There are no additional parameters you can pass into `st.divider()`.
