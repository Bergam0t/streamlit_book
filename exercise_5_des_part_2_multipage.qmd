# Exercise 5: DEStiny's Child

It’s time to enhance our DES app a bit!

Take a copy of your original version first and store it somewhere safe!

Do these steps in the order listed, and take the time to make sure it’s working after each step.

- Add a run button

- Split your code out into separate files for the web app and the DES classes, then import the DES classes where you need them and update how the g class values are set

- Turn your app into a multipage app
    - Make the first page give a brief explanation of what the app actually is
    - Make the second page allow people to run the simulation

## Bonus Tasks

- Add the HSMA logo to your app (it’s provided in the exercise_2 folder)

- Create a custom colourscheme for your app using a config.toml file in a .streamlit subfolder

- Import the file style.css into your app to change the font of your app
