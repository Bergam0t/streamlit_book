You get a 7 breakfast credit for the restaurant which was cool, although I think I prefer traditional continental breakfasts that are buffet style. The wifi was fast, so that was good. I didn't use the pool/hot tub/gym BUT it looked clean and ready to use. The staff was very friendly and helpful."

2,Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Waterville,2015-08-03T00:00:00Z,44.57059,-69.64012,3.0,Adequate but nothing to recommend it.
3,Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Waterville,2014-08-13T00:00:00Z,44.57059,-69.64012,4.0,"Great service, comfortable hotel. Rug was wet in our room by the window. Otherwise, a super hotel - and a great breakfast!"
4,Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Waterville,2015-07-03T00:00:00Z,44.57059,-69.64012,5.0,excellent place to stay and food was super...great breakfast and friendly staff

6,Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Waterville,2015-09-29T00:00:00Z,44.57059,-69.64012,3.0,"We had 3 of us and they had no queen rooms available!! Beds were small! Breakfast was not included as written! Breakfast was a $14. Voucher and for only 2 people, not 3! So, we did not use it at all! Went elsewhere to eat! Also, when Maid service came in room to make beds and such ... They didn't leave fresh towels or new coffee packets!"
7,Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Waterville,2016-07-02T00:00:00Z,44.57059,-69.64012,2.0,"If you need an elevator this is not the place to go. It is in a strange place. The breakfast was not at all to rave about. Muffins, scrambled eggs cold cereal, juice. We didn't use the pool, no time for that."
8,Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Waterville,2015-10-29T00:00:00Z,44.57059,-69.64012,4.0,The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. After 10 days they felt like family. The restaurant is very good as well. Was happy that my room had a refrigerator and a nice little view of the courtyard. My only hope for my next stay would be better cleaning/upkeep of the air conditioning/heating unit. I suffered awful upper respiratory symptoms when the unit was in use. I'm guessing the filters need to be cleaned and/or replaced more frequently.

11,Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Waterville,2016-02-20T00:00:00Z,44.57059,-69.64012,5.0,"Hotel was very clean and staff very nice. Beds are only double instead of Queen which makes traveling with two teenage boys not easy. Ordered a cot but really no room to set up had to block bathroom. Great for a two person stay, also free breakfast was for only two people, so had to pay for kids."
12,Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Waterville,2015-08-09T00:00:00Z,44.57059,-69.64012,3.0,"This is my second stay recently. Rooms are decent but you can forget about the amenities they advertise. The pool is nice, but good luck finding a towel or staff person. Its not easy to get the complimentary breakfast.......you need to know the secret handshake then be prepared to wait an hour for a server and even more for the meal to cook. If you try to have breakfast there take a look around the restaurant and see how many table have food.......or more likely you will see empty tables with angry/hungry customers and 1 server trying to keep everyone happy.Its a decent hotel that does not hire enough staff to maintain the amenities. I feel bad for the employees of this hotel.......they are very pleasant but obviously over worked. This hotel is good if you need a place to crash but that is about it. I will try a different hotel when I am in Waterville again."
13,Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Waterville,2015-11-18T00:00:00Z,44.57059,-69.64012,5.0,great time and the breakfast was extra good the rest. in the hotel was also very good
14,Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Waterville,2015-07-03T00:00:00Z,44.57059,-69.64012,3.0,"Didn't feel overly safe as the doors from the parking lot are left unlocked. I know, I know, we are in Maine...but still. Clean and well equipped...only complaint was lack of outlets for charging. Very inaccessible. Perfect for a quick stay. Very pleasant desk clerk :)"
15,Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Waterville,2015-08-17T00:00:00Z,44.57059,-69.64012,4.0,"They should clean the rugs around the elevators, The room was very clean"
16,Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Waterville,2015-10-09T00:00:00Z,44.57059,-69.64012,5.0,Free breakfast was great dinner not so much. I don't know why I thought sweet potato encrusted haddock sounded good. They also buried it in a white gravy. Gravy does not belong on fish.
17,Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Waterville,2015-08-17T00:00:00Z,44.57059,-69.64012,3.0,"Hotel was clean and room size was fine. Mini fridge and microwave in room were a plus. Pool area was nice with good sized pool and fitness equipment. Restaurant food was good (we got a 14 credit to use for breakfast between the three of us so it still cost 20) but service was very slow. The first floor, which we walked through to get to the elevator, reeked of cigarette smoke. This can be avoided by parking out back or using the stairs. My biggest complaint was the WIFI. I paid for a hotel rather than camping because I needed WIFI to get some work done. While I could get my phone to connect, my computer would not recognize the free signal. After 20 minutes on hold with the tech support group, the answer that I got was to sit next to the door. This worked to connect but the signal dropped again once I moved back into the room. The promise that they would reset the signal did not seem to be kept as this was an issue both nights I was there. Overall this was a decent hotel and much better than what others in our group experienced at competitors in the area."
18,Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Waterville,2015-08-17T00:00:00Z,44.57059,-69.64012,4.0,"The hotel was very clean, comfortable, and accommodating to the fact that we had a dog. However the restaurant that is attached to the hotel is what they use for the 'included breakfast', which has the poorest customer service and rudest employees I've encountered in a while."
19,Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Waterville,2015-08-21T00:00:00Z,44.57059,-69.64012,4.0,"It's a decent hotel for the price. They provide a solid breakfast, and the rooms are really nice. The only problem is their wifi is spotty if you're in the back of the building."
20,Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Waterville,2016-01-02T00:00:00Z,44.57059,-69.64012,4.0,It was an overnighter to get away from some stuff
21,Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Waterville,2015-07-14T00:00:00Z,44.57059,-69.64012,4.0,Stayed overnight for pleasure. Room was clean and well equipped. Pool was great.
22,Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Waterville,2015-08-13T00:00:00Z,44.57059,-69.64012,2.0,"Ok overall - we stayed one night with our dogs. We were limited in our choices because of this. Hotel could use updating. Was a little bit noisy in the halls, but overall ok. Did not eat on site but at Governor's across the street."
23,Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Waterville,2016-01-30T00:00:00Z,44.57059,-69.64012,4.0,"I just ran up to the middle of Maine for a one day business trip. All the people that I had interacted with were very nice, from the people at the hotel to the business staff and owner, and all the people at the various restaurants we ate at. This hotel is dog friendly which was the main reason for... More"
24,Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Waterville,2015-11-15T00:00:00Z,44.57059,-69.64012,4.0,"Rooms have been updated and are very nice.  Pool was a huge hit with our grandchildren but  needs an ""intensive"" cleaning.  They host birthday parties and it would be good if they posted times because it gets way too crazy to enjoy when that many kids are there."
25,Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Waterville,2016-01-25T00:00:00Z,44.57059,-69.64012,3.0,I only booked this hotel because it was dog friendly
26,Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Waterville,2016-07-13T00:00:00Z,44.57059,-69.64012,4.0,"We booked a one night stay at the Best Western on a trip to Maine. The was located right at the exit off Route 95. The check inn staff were pleasant and informative. Our room was large, clean and comfortable. It included a refrigerator and microwave as well as a small coffee brewer with the fixings. Our room charge also... More"
27,Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Waterville,2016-05-13T00:00:00Z,44.57059,-69.64012,3.0,"We did not realize it is a dog friendly hotel and there were lots of dogs, including a yappy one right next to us. But I called the front desk and they took care of it. I am allergic to dogs but did not have any problem in our room. The breakfast service was horribly slow, both getting seated and waiting for coffee and food. Who wants to wait for coffee I finally got my own out in the hallway. . . . Our last morning we just skipped breakfast because we didn't want to wait."
28,Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Waterville,2016-01-08T00:00:00Z,44.57059,-69.64012,5.0,Great place
29,Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Waterville,2015-08-03T00:00:00Z,44.57059,-69.64012,2.0,Room was not clean. We didn't feel comfortable. Cigarette burns in comforter.
30,Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Waterville,2016-06-06T00:00:00Z,44.57059,-69.64012,3.0,"The hotel was comfortable.  It appeared to be popular with workers and truckers.  Families appeared to like the indoor swimming pool, which I did not use.  The restaurant appeared to be a place where contractors went."
31,Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Waterville,2015-07-14T00:00:00Z,44.57059,-69.64012,4.0,Stayed overnight for pleasure. Room was clean and well equipped. Pool was great.

33,Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Waterville,2014-07-25T00:00:00Z,44.57059,-69.64012,1.0,1. The door to the room was broken and did not shut properly.2. WiFi frequently stopped working and the staff would not help and told us that we had to work it out with the IT tech from some other company.I would expect the hotel to take care of this.3. We payed for 3 people but they said they would only provide breakfast for 2. I had an unpleasant haggle with the management to finally work this out
34,Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Waterville,2014-09-13T00:00:00Z,44.57059,-69.64012,1.0,There was someone else's stuff left in our washroom.  The person at the counter was snotty when she saw that I had reserved online.
35,Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Waterville,2014-08-22T00:00:00Z,44.57059,-69.64012,3.0,"Fast friendly service by all staff.  Could tell rooms were renovated and clean and comfortable, pool area was a little tired with age but functional."
36,Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Waterville,2016-07-11T00:00:00Z,44.57059,-69.64012,3.0,"The front desk staff was very friendly and helpful. The room and facility was spotless. The restaurant was terrible. I made the mistake of ordering one of the specials, prime rib. It was without a doubt the worst prime rib I have ever eaten or should I say tried to eat. Our server asked how it was so I told... More"
37,Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Waterville,2014-08-28T00:00:00Z,44.57059,-69.64012,5.0,"Clean room, comfortable beds, lots of pillows. My only complaint is the continental breakfast. Cold cereal, coffee, tea, OJ, toast and muffins. No fresh fruit or yogurt. They offer a full menu, but you pay for it."
38,Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Waterville,2015-10-01T00:00:00Z,44.57059,-69.64012,4.0,The staff was fantastic. Nice room. Could have used more than 2 bath towels. It was a little noisy in the morning... I think it had to do with the washing machine... sounded like a loud helicopter. I was a little disappointed when I went to swim in the morning that there was a senior exercise class going on using the entire pool and only a single lap aisle so no room for me to take a swim. It was a good stay and I would stay there again.
39,Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Waterville,2016-08-09T00:00:00Z,44.57059,-69.64012,3.0,"i had a great time nice hotel, friendly staff and clean room"

42,Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Waterville,2014-10-12T00:00:00Z,44.57059,-69.64012,3.0,"Das Hotel ist in die Jahre gekommen und kaum erneuert worden. Die Lage ist f��r Autoreisende als Etappenhalt geeignet, weil direkt an Autobahn gelegen.Angenehm war, dass kein typisch amerikanischen Fr��hst��cksbuffet vorhanden war, sondern man am Tisch bedient wurde. Bei unserer Buchung gab es einen Kredit von 7 USD pro Person, welcher f��r ein einfaches Fr��hst��ck ausreichend war."
43,Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Waterville,2015-08-08T00:00:00Z,44.57059,-69.64012,5.0,Great stay. friendly front desk staff. Breakfast in the restaurant was great but dinner was blah. Only issue with the room was the dust pilled up on the shelf where the towels are kept in the bathroom. Other then that I would stay here again.
44,Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Waterville,2015-06-08T00:00:00Z,44.57059,-69.64012,4.0,"Need more staff in restraunt on busy weekend. Sat. morning breakfast a disaster. Long wait, wrong order. Otherwise a very good stay. And much better than in past years."
45,Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Waterville,2015-09-13T00:00:00Z,44.57059,-69.64012,1.0,Hotel smelled musty and had to move rooms water in shower would not turn off did not fell or smell clear either room would not stay again
46,Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Waterville,2016-06-16T00:00:00Z,44.57059,-69.64012,4.0,"The hotel was fine, just know that smoking is allowed on some floors so there is lingering tobacco odor in some corridors. O'Brien's was a nice surprise, good food and great service. Also, a true breakfast is included with the price of the room, cooked to order not the typical complimentary breakfast buffet. The internet speed was good as well."
47,Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Waterville,2015-08-25T00:00:00Z,44.57059,-69.64012,4.0,One night layover. Hotel was good for that but wouldn't want to stay more than that
48,Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Waterville,2015-08-02T00:00:00Z,44.57059,-69.64012,3.0,"The hotel itself was quiet, and the location was easy to find but could use some updates.  I went to use the gym and two out of the three treadmills were broken.  The room was also beside the pool making it very humid and uncomfortable.  The shower located in my room leaked all over the bathroom floor."
49,Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Waterville,2016-03-01T00:00:00Z,44.57059,-69.64012,1.0,"The inside of the Hotel is old and it smells. The elevators had a n harsh smell of oil. When I reserved my room through Hotels.com it mentioned ""Free Breakfast"" - what a joke. It's a voucher (1 person is allowed $7 off a breakfast of the menu, and $14 total off for 2 or more people at the restaurant. It's really false publicity! I will not be staying at that hotel again. Bathroom in the room was not cleaned. Mirrors were dirty. It's like the rooms were done in a hurry! Roll away bed was pushed in the room with no pillow and a very thin blanket. The reservation was for 3. Just a set of 2 towels. We had the heat full blast, and we froze in the middle of the night. Very poor managed!"
50,Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Waterville,2014-08-27T00:00:00Z,44.57059,-69.64012,4.0,"the hotel was great , clean etc. but that one desk lady was like not to helpful - and the business center is a desk next to the hotel desk and the computer didn't have Microsoft installed and that one desk lady is totally computer unaware and could not do anything to help with the business center malfunctions - except to say. yes, those computers didn't work right and that she knew you couldn't open any attachments and that staples was across the street."
51,Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Waterville,2015-08-01T00:00:00Z,44.57059,-69.64012,4.0,"nice experience, breakfast the first day was questionable, but we tried the next day and was pleased."

53,Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Waterville,2015-08-19T00:00:00Z,44.57059,-69.64012,5.0,Very nice room.loved the pool. Could have been lower in price but would stay there again.
54,Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Waterville,2015-07-06T00:00:00Z,44.57059,-69.64012,4.0,Checked in unexepectedly at the last minute. Never spent enough time at the hotel to make any other fair comments. Everything was perfect for what we needed.
55,Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Waterville,2015-10-23T00:00:00Z,44.57059,-69.64012,4.0,"OK hotell i utkanten av Waterville. Ganska lugnt l��ge. Hotellet har pool, restaurang och bar och ��ven tillg��ng till g��sttv��ttmaskiner + tummlare."
56,Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Waterville,2016-02-11T00:00:00Z,44.57059,-69.64012,1.0,"No coffee in lobby, front desk suggested I but some at the hotel restaurant. Parking lot was icy and not plowed, even after several complaints. Did not comply with Platinum Status rules. Reservations didn't match room location. Front desk staff was not knowledgeable. Room was nice."
57,Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Waterville,2016-06-23T00:00:00Z,44.57059,-69.64012,1.0,"All the hallways smell of smoke. The room was dirty when we checked in. The next day they never sent housekeeping to clean. Did not give us clean towels in spite of the request for those and housekeeping services. They said the housekeepers had all gone home. The restaurant was terrible service. One person waiting on the room over breakfast the first day. Twenty minutes to receive a menu and then nothing after the meal was delivered. We got our own flatware and coffee. The second day there was more staff but the waitress decided to change my plain yogurt to blueberry. I am allergic. Had to send it back. I asked for a manager to contact me but no one called. Called corporate and they wanted to give me points. Called Mr. Kong, the president of Best Western and they will give me a 50.00 credit, the first offer was a gift certificate for 50.00 No thanks, I wont ever stay in another Best Western again. The hotel manager has still not contacted me, its been three weeks."
58,Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Waterville,2016-04-10T00:00:00Z,44.57059,-69.64012,4.0,"Cramped location with odd entry by traffic light, clearly caters to groups and sports teams. Nicest staff ever! Room was clean and comfortable, is a single story building, so rooms go on forever down long hallways. Lucky we were near the gym, which was better than most. Great breakfast at a very reasonable price. Room includes a voucher for up to 14.00 of your breakfast order, so you get a hot meal straight from the short order cook, not some steam table/cereal bar like most places. Portions were huge! Free buffet with pizza, cheese/crackers, veggies and dip from 4-7pm on Friday evenings in the bar. Facility is a bit quirky and a bit tired, but staff is warm and friendly.Wish we had eaten dinner there and not at the disappointing Chinese restaurant next door!"
59,Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Waterville,2016-02-14T00:00:00Z,44.57059,-69.64012,4.0,"We enjoyed two great days away. They let us check in early and check out late for free. The hot tub was great, pool was a little loud because of school vacation but the attendant was the friendliest gentleman. Wifi didn't work well with just one of our three devices. Breakfast was definitely worth getting out of bed for. Will definitely consider staying there again for a getaway or business."
60,Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Waterville,2015-06-10T00:00:00Z,44.57059,-69.64012,4.0,Excellent for short stay. Very comfortable bed for good night's sleep.Breakfast a bit disorganised and could cause a problem if on tight schedule.

63,Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Waterville,2015-08-02T00:00:00Z,44.57059,-69.64012,1.0,Old and run down. Tried to eat at the restaurant in the hote for breakfast and the service was so terrible we walked out. I would not stay there again.

68,Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Waterville,2015-09-17T00:00:00Z,44.57059,-69.64012,4.0,We stayed for 3 nights and the first night was great. Room could have been a little cleaner especially the carpet and corners of room. Lots of dust so allergies became a problem. BIG NOTE! This is a dog friendly hotel! I love dogs and have 2 of my own but do not bring them to hotels. The 2nd night a dog actually 2 dogs started barking at 4:00 am. We were woken up until 6:00! The hotel usually has the 1st floor reserved for barking dogs but these people ended up on the 2nd floor. The Hotel kindly gave us credit for the one night. Not sure if I would stay there again.

But I called the front desk and they took care of it. I am allergic to dogs but did not have any problem in our room.The breakfast service was horribly slow, both getting seated and waiting for coffee and food. Who wants to wait for coffee? I finally got my own out in the hallway. . . . Our last morning we just skipped breakfast because we didn't want to wait."

However the restaurant that is attached to the hotel is what they use for the 'included breakfast', which has the poorest customer service and rudest employees I've encountered in a while."

This created a problem when others were sleeping and someone needed to wash their hands. The breakfast in the restaurant was better than most places we have stayed, even though it was not as good as it could have been. Overall I would only rate this hotel as fair."

Hotel is suppose to be family friendly and staff was walking through the same halls and didn't appear to care. Pool was rented out to a birthday party of non guests to the hotel so overpacked and could not swim. Later it was quite dirty and the hot tub had hair and dirt floating in it. Was given 2 towels and washclothes for a room with 4 people. Shower only got luke warm. Free breakfast advertised was not free. ""Free"" is actually for 2 people and you still pay tax and gratuity. Website and book in room states there are snack vending machines at the hotel when there is not. They have soda and ice machines only. Very disappointing."

90,Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Waterville,2015-04-29T00:00:00Z,44.57059,-69.64012,2.0,Well they must be in the midst of renovations because they did not tell any of their customers and there was dust and materials left all over the hallways. It was like the workers just up and left everything out in the open and materials all over the place. The beds were uncomfortable and there was noises all night from the heating unit. The blinds were duct taped together and the parking lights came through the curtains. And the continental breakfast was a joke. My family went down at 8:15 am and they had nothing ready. Needless to say I am never going to stay there again and we checked out early and went to eat at the Friendly's next door where it was cleaner.I wish that I can get my money refunded because it was not worth the money that I spent.

Then we had to wait a half hour for our room, even though when I called earlier in the day they said our room would be ready when we got there and we could come whenever since we had payed already. We also had ants in our room. Overall it was not a great stay,and I would like to request a free night stay or else I probably will not stay at your hotels anymore. I used to stay in them a good amount, and I am sorry to say that but that is how I feel."

It was clean and the staff was friendly. the work out area and pool was a good size and the hot tub was relaxing. the restaurant was resealable, but the only thing there I didn't like was getting a water with dinner that came in a plastic cup.

When I reserved my room through Hotels.com it mentioned Free Breakfast - what a joke. It's a voucher (1 person is allowed 7 off a breakfast of the menu, and 14 total off for 2 or more people at the restaurant. It's really false publicity! I will not be staying at that hotel again. Bathroom in the room was not cleaned. Mirrors were dirty. It's like the rooms were done in a hurry! Roll away bed was pushed in the room with no pillow and a very thin blanket. The reservation was for 3. Just a set of 2 towels. We had the heat full blast, and we froze in the middle of the night. Very poor managed!"

But since I had booked thru Expedia, they stated that I had to get approval thru them, which I did. Upon check-out I asked to verify that I was only being charged for the 3 nights as opposed to the 4, and they said I was only being charged for the 3 days, and gave me a receipt showing that. But the next day, my credit card used for that stay posted the amount for a 4 night stay. In calling the front desk, I got form letter like answers.

We ended up arriving earlier than expected and when I called to see if we could check in early; the response was very welcoming.My only critique would be the constant slamming of doors in the morning by housekeeping. They use the lock bar to keep the door in-locked while they go in and out to clean. The problem then becomes the constant loud slamming of doors

Pool area was nice with good sized pool and fitness equipment. Restaurant food was good (we got a $14 credit to use for breakfast between the three of us so it still cost $20) but service was very slow. The first floor, which we walked through to get to the elevator, reeked of cigarette smoke. This can be avoided by parking out back or using the stairs. My biggest complaint was the WIFI. I paid for a hotel rather than camping because I needed WIFI to get some work done. While I could get my phone to connect, my computer would not recognize the free signal. After 20 minutes on hold with the tech support group, the answer that I got was to sit next to the door. This worked to connect but the signal dropped again once I moved back into the room. The promise that they would reset the signal did not seem to be kept as this was an issue both nights I was there. Overall this was a decent hotel and much better than what others in our group experienced at competitors in the area."

140,Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Waterville,2015-08-19T00:00:00Z,44.57059,-69.64012,2.0,"Ok overall - we stayed one night with our dogs. We were limited in our choices because of this. Hotel could use updating. Was a little bit noisy in the halls, but overall ok. Did not eat on site but at Governor's across the street."
141,Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Waterville,2016-09-19T00:00:00Z,44.57059,-69.64012,2.0,Staff very friendly.  Some areas of the hotel look like they have been updated but some do not.  Room was clean but halls looked dated and worn.  I have not stayed in other hotels in area so I don'the have a basis for comparison.  Convenient to highway.
142,Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Waterville,2016-01-25T00:00:00Z,44.57059,-69.64012,5.0,The pool and hot tub area was wonderful! The pool attendant could have let our kids do a bit more in the pool we are are responsible parents and were watching them ourselves. We wanted them to have fun and not have a pool attendant constantly on top of them. The fitness room was big and spacious.
143,Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Waterville,2015-06-22T00:00:00Z,44.57059,-69.64012,4.0,"I asked for a nonsmoking room and was pleased with the fact that it didn't seem like other people were smoking, so that's good. You get a $7 breakfast credit for the restaurant which was cool, although I think I prefer traditional continental breakfasts that are buffet style. The wifi was fast, so that was good. I didn't use the pool/hot tub/gym BUT it looked clean and ready to use. The staff was very friendly and helpful."

146,Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Waterville,2015-09-22T00:00:00Z,44.57059,-69.64012,4.0,We stayed for 3 nights and the first night was great. Room could have been a little cleaner especially the carpet and corners of room. Lots of dust so allergies became a problem. BIG NOTE! This is a dog friendly hotel! I love dogs and have 2 of my own but do not bring them to hotels. The 2nd night a dog actually 2 dogs started barking at 4:00 am. We were woken up until @6:00! The hotel usually has the 1st floor reserved for barking dogs but these people ended up on the 2nd floor. The Hotel kindly gave us credit for the one night. Not sure if I would stay there again.
147,Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Waterville,2015-03-17T00:00:00Z,44.57059,-69.64012,1.0,"Very loud rowdy customers staff would not do anything about the frat like partying.  Pool was good, hot tub was disgusting.  I really do not have anything good to say about this hotel.  I will never stay here again or recommend it to anyone."
148,Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Waterville,2016-08-18T00:00:00Z,44.57059,-69.64012,5.0,The motel was very nice place and the staff were great at all time. They were ready to help all the time. My wife sister died while we were there. They could not do enough for us. The only thing is they keep it to cold at he front desk and restaurant. We would stay there the next time we go buy.

150,Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Waterville,2015-10-02T00:00:00Z,44.57059,-69.64012,4.0,The staff was fantastic.  Nice room.  Could have used more than 2 bath towels.  It was a little noisy in the morning... I think it had to do with the washing machine... sounded like a loud helicopter.  I was a little disappointed when I went to swim in the morning that there was a senior exercise class going on using the entire pool and only a single lap aisle so no room for me to take a swim.It was a good stay and I would stay there again.

Hotel is older but they come in and clean room every. Wifi works well. Comes with voucher for breakfast. I read some bad comments about the food but we found it to be very good. You can get the buffet on the weekend or order off the menu with a certain $ credit. Eggs, french toast and pancakes with fresh Maine blueberries very good. Yogurt parfait with granola also yummy. Located on a busy street, many shops and places to eat right there."
153,Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Waterville,2014-08-10T00:00:00Z,44.57059,-69.64012,4.0,Crazy lady at the desk would not give me a receipt - she said I had to get if from hotel. Com. And the guest computer / business's center had such a strong fire wall I could not open my flash drive to open my documents and micro soft office. The man in the hot tub followed me into the locker room and made an offer to give me free whatever - that's not the hotels fault just kinda crazy . Not a bad place.

This created a problem when others were sleeping and someone needed to wash their hands. The breakfast in the restaurant was better than most places we have stayed, even though it was not as good as it could have been. Overall I would only rate this hotel as fair."
165,Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Waterville,2015-11-09T00:00:00Z,44.57059,-69.64012,4.0,The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. After 10 days they felt like family. The restaurant is very good as well. Was happy that my room had a refrigerator and a nice little view of the courtyard. My only hope for my next stay would be better cleaning/upkeep of the air conditioning/heating unit. I suffered awful upper respiratory symptoms when the unit was in use. I'm guessing the filters need to be cleaned and/or replaced more frequently.
166,Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Waterville,2016-10-23T00:00:00Z,44.57059,-69.64012,5.0,Nice rooms. Very clean. Front staff was polite and courteous.

Staff was very gracious and accommodating. We were passing through so one night stay. Did not eat in restaurant because alternatives were very close by. Rate was not a bargain but worth the price.
170,Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Waterville,2014-06-10T00:00:00Z,44.57059,-69.64012,4.0,"Hotel was good. Indoor pool was the draw AND it was actually very warm. Great job! However, I do NOT recommend eating at the hotel restaurant...HORRIBLE service, so/so food quality. With only 3 people at the bar and 2 in restaurant it shouldn't have taken 35 minutes to get an order of nachos, then when it came out, the order was wrong!! Waited another 30 mins for the main dish. Pasta over cooked, chicken rubbery, even my 4 yr old wouldn't eat it. Good stay, but eat elsewhere."

They offer memberships to the pool and exercise room to non guests. Pool was not very clean. Was given 2 towels and wash clothes for 4 people in a room. Website stated free breakfast but neglected to say it was for 2 and you pay tax and gratuity for the free ones also. Website and book in room said there are snack vending machines and there are only ice and soda vending machines. Shower was luke warm and no way to make it warmer. Worst hotel I have ever stayed in.

We requested a non smoking room , but the entire first floor smelled of smoke!! Rooms are very old and dark. Shower which I was even scared to step into barefoot didn't get above Luke warm. The little coffee machine in the room also didn't work..it was just bad all the way around!! I wasn't expecting fancy being a best western but clean and not outdated would have been nice! Stay elsewhere! !"
178,Best Western Plus Waterville Grand Hotel,Waterville,2016-05-02T00:00:00Z,44.57059,-69.64012,4.0,Upgraded motel with an extremely comfortable bed and quiet room on the top (third) floor.

The next day they never sent housekeeping to clean.  Did not give us clean towels in spite of the request for those and housekeeping services.  They said the housekeepers had all gone home.  The restaurant was terrible service.  One person waiting on the room over breakfast the first day.  Twenty minutes to receive a menu and then nothing after the meal was delivered.  We got our own flatware and coffee.  The second day there was more staff but the waitress decided to change my plain yogurt to blueberry.  I am allergic.  Had to send it back.  I asked for a manager to contact me but no one called.  Called corporate and they wanted to give me points.  Called Mr. Kong, the president of Best Western and they will give me a $50.00 credit, the first offer was a gift certificate for $50.00  No thanks, I wont ever stay in another Best Western again.  The hotel manager has still not contacted me, its been three weeks."

The brochurers for Sept. had already been thrown away and Oct- Dec. in its place. So we had no idea what there was to do in this town. I couldn't get connected to Internet wirelessly nor through cable. So I couldn't look things up and I could not send my work via internet at all during my stay. The breakfast in the restaurant was about the worst I have ever had, and the price made it even harder to swallow. JUST GROSS- we had the buffet. We chose Bay City only because my husband wanted to book a NICE HOTEL which now seems like a huge mistake. I have traveled all around the US and stay in various hotels. This was very clean, but other than that it was a huge waste of our money. For the price of these rooms I expected a great deal more. A balcony for sure when your paying for a river view. We found the HIDDEN microwave and mini fridge on the DAY WE WERE LEAVING, that would have been nice to use during our stay. JUST A WASTE of money."

It was my girl birthday, so I call them to make sure that I got a large bathtub and a king size bed. When I got to my room, I had the smallest tube in the world. Remind you that I'm 6'1' and a big dude. They also gave me a small double bed. My leg was hanging out the bed the whole night. To make thing even worse, I went out to dinner with my girl and than came back to the same sheet they had the night before. They basically put a clean sheet on top of the dirty sheet. I didn't notice it until I pull the white sheet to check the bed. They didn't change our pillow sheet at all. I wouldn't get mad if it was a cheap hotel. I paid 125 dollar a night for that room and they have the audacity to not change my bed sheet. I was so embarrass for bringing my girl to this hotel. The picture look good online, but when you get to the hotel, it's a different ball game. The room is not that large, compare to the picture. They didn't even have a microwave in the room. I once pay 55 dollar for a hotel room that gave me everything I wanted in orlando, a king size bed and clean sheet. I wish I could get my money back. NOT HAPPY"

It was my first time in West Palm Beach. I was barely impressed with this hotel, being a large name brand, I expected more. The room was centrally located near the airport and highways which was great, thankfully we decided to rent a car because there was no scenery or activities to do near the hotel. The outside and lobby was pretty, very similar to other business hotels. I was extremely dissapointed upon check in when we realized the hotel pool was not only not in service, but it was completely empty. That was the only reason we booked this hotel was for the pool so again we had to drive to even swim on our family vacation. The room was mediocre, similar to a stay at our local hotels in the north east. The breakfast was over priced 15 per person for a breakfast buffet. Overall I would suggest not staying here while on vacation unless you are fully aware in order to do anything fun you must drive there. Also be sure to call before you check in to be sure the pool is in service. For the amount that was spend which was almost 150 per night I think we could have found a better place for our first family trip with our daughter. Good luck hope this helps."

I expected a more higher class of hotel. It does not hold up to what a Hilton used to be. This hotel did not have a TV guide in the room nor on the TV screen for guests to know what was playing in Florida. That was the biggest complaint. There was a list of stations, such as, ABC, NBC, HGTV, etc. That was all in the room. When I called down for assistance, I was told that that was all the hotel had to offer. I also expected a better quality of coffee maker. The staff was excellent however. Overall, I will not put hotels bought out by Hilton on my list of places to stay in the future. I am sure the Hilton's are first class not the ones they attached their names to."

I had just flown in and lost my phone at the TSA check in the airport from where I took off, so I was a bit agitated. I explained my dilemma and although I was extremely early they did their best to get a room available and gave me directions to the t-mobile store so I could get a replacement phone. By the time I returned the room was ready and the woman who checked me in had a message from my wife and she read it aloud to me in such a nice way. I was really impressed by the welcome and all the help. The room was nicely decorated and I was just looking to take a shower and relax a bit before I went to meet up with some friends. And there it was... black mold in the shower. Clearly visible and of course once I saw it I looked under some of the fixtures in the shower and found a lot more. Gross. Other than that the room was basically very comfortable. Air conditioning worked well. Television worked well. Free WiFi was a treat. Outlets galore for your cell phones, tablets, laptops etc. Really efficient room. Pool was nice. Fitness room was clean and modern facilities. It was so difficult to actually get someone to assist you in the restaurant that I walked out twice and found someplace else to eat. That and the black mold were the only negative aspects. I would definitely stay there again. Oh and the self parking made for easy mobility if you rent a car. If not, use uber as the cab cost 3x more."

The desk staff is very pleasant, the courtyard when you walk up is cute. The room is a nightmare. I wish I could add photos. The only chair was very wobbly, we never sat on it. When I sat up against the headboard, my shirt stuck to it. The kitchen had huge cracks radiating out all over the wall. The bathroom ceiling had little mold spots over the shower as there was no ventilation. The toilet seat used to be white, but was worn down to the wooden base in most spots. The white shelf over the bathroom sink was literally shredding apart. It looked like an asbestos base that had been soaking in water for a year. It was literally puffing up from inside out. It was a cheap place to stay, but not so cheap that they can't fix basic problems. The neighborhood is right by the key arena. You can walk to the space needle, public transportation is easy from here. A few nights there won't kill you, but you aren't going to want to spend much time in the room!"
730,Inn At Queen Anne,Seattle,2016-07-24T00:00:00Z,47.62332,-122.35542,1.0,No elevators. Week aircondioner. A/C located by the bed. Half the stove would not light up. Neighborhood is iffy.
731,Inn At Queen Anne,Seattle,2016-05-13T00:00:00Z,47.62332,-122.35542,3.0,The room was way outdated and the shower head was made for a person 5 feet tall but for a one night stay it was okay. It was perfect for going to the concert that was right across the street at Key Arena. You do have to pay for parking though. 20 dollars a night
732,Inn At Queen Anne,Seattle,2016-05-22T00:00:00Z,47.62332,-122.35542,4.0,"Hotel was in a area which was close to the monorail and easy walk to the local supermarket. Once on the monorail it is an easy walk into the city and down to the market. Also it is close to the space needle which has great views of the city on a clear day. One of the best attractions is the trip to the Boeing factory which is out of town, but well worth getting a tour which will pick you up from your hotel and return you at the end of the tour."
733,Inn At Queen Anne,Seattle,2016-05-19T00:00:00Z,47.62332,-122.35542,2.0,"Looks better n the photos. Paint peeling in bathroom, old carpet, weird shaped room, very old and not so safe neighborhood."
734,Inn At Queen Anne,Seattle,2016-05-23T00:00:00Z,47.62332,-122.35542,4.0,"Stayed at Inn at Queen Anne to attend the Who concert. The inn is no more than 3 block from the Key Arena entrance. When the concert was over, we were back in our room within 15 minutes. The inn is older and basic. Be aware there is an additional fee surcharge beyond the nightly rate. When I asked what the surcharge was for (we didn't need parking, there was no breakfast offered and no afternoon wine), the desk attendant talked about the phone in the room. I think a better explanation should be prepared."
735,Inn At Queen Anne,Seattle,2016-06-17T00:00:00Z,47.62332,-122.35542,2.0,"I stayed here with a couple friends the night before doing the Seattle Rock n Roll half marathon. We live a little under an hour away, so we were just coming up for the evening. We called early in the day to inquire about parking and were told that the Inn had their own parking lot so it was no problem to pay to park when we arrived later. Well, when we checked in we were told the parking lot was full, sorry. I was shocked and disappointed that no other explanation or assitance was given. The lady at reception simply handed me a map of some nearby lots and suggested we just park on the street. Well, good luck finding street parking on a Friday evening! We drove around for over an hour until we could find a spot. We then had to move our car in the morning before the race. This was a huge inconvenience. We stopped by hotel reception after driving around for an hour to inquire about late check-out. We were told the hotel doesn't offer late check-out, and even after explaining our frustration about driving around for an hour (or more) looking for parking, she simply said, there's nothing I can do. We were very disappointed in the lack of service, lack of genuine apology, and absence of any sort of gesture for our inconvenience. Needless to say, we will not be back."
736,Inn At Queen Anne,Seattle,2016-05-15T00:00:00Z,47.62332,-122.35542,3.0,"Other hotels in the area were MUCH pricier than this one. The room was very clean and the employees quite friendly. Location was great very easy to walk to the various Seattle sights, restaurants, etc. Windows weren't well insulated so you could hear EVERYTHING from the street at night (including the poor homeless guy yelling obscenities at 2 am, which wasn't the hotel's fault). Bed was fairly uncomfortable but we were only there for one night so overall this hotel for fine for our needs."
737,Inn At Queen Anne,Seattle,2016-07-15T00:00:00Z,47.62332,-122.35542,4.0,"If you are looking for a modern hotel with all the extras then keep looking - but if you need a comfortable bed in a quaint little inn then this is the place for you. The hotel is old, but has lots of character and the staff is very helpful and friendly. Our group enjoyed the little courtyard outside to sit and visit. The location is perfect for seeing the Space Needle and other local areas. We got into Seattle early in the day, but the clerk very kindly help our luggage and told us of a local food festival that was happening just two blocks away. What a fun afternoon we had! We called Uber to transport us to the Pike's Market and back to the hotel again. We walked just a little over a block to a wonderful grocery store for our breakfast the next morning."
738,Inn At Queen Anne,Seattle,2016-05-24T00:00:00Z,47.62332,-122.35542,2.0,"I sorry I cannot recommend this place. Unless you are totally able to block out the outside noise(people, traffic and construction) and the underwhelming conditions of the room (extremely basic room with very old plumbing and windows) I have a personal preference of staying somewhere quiet."
739,Inn At Queen Anne,Seattle,2016-05-03T00:00:00Z,47.62332,-122.35542,4.0,"My second stay at Inn at Queen Anne. The building is old, but I love the character. Full kitchen, minimally stocked but all I needed. Comfortable bed, nice hot showers, friendly and helpful staff. Great grocery store within a block, theatre, ballet and music options very close. City location, so a couple of times there was a little noise from the street, but minimal and did not disturb me. This is my home away from home now and I would not stay anywhere else."
740,Inn At Queen Anne,Seattle,2016-07-15T00:00:00Z,47.62332,-122.35542,4.0,Not the most luxurious room but cheap for the area! Good restaurants right next door and you can walk to all the main sights!
741,Inn At Queen Anne,Seattle,2016-05-18T00:00:00Z,47.62332,-122.35542,3.0,Beautiful hotel but bad management and very frustrating check in with hidden fees
742,Inn At Queen Anne,Seattle,2016-06-29T00:00:00Z,47.62332,-122.35542,1.0,"Hotel was definitely not worth the money...they charge an extra person fee (yes I know it's listed on the website) but I think it's ridiculous to charge 15/person extra per day (20 with taxes!) when there are no services the extra person is even utilizing....no continental breakfast, no extra bed provided so what's the point not to mention the woman who checked us in suggested moving us to a different room on the first floor with a cot (after lugging heavy suitcases up three flights of stairs due to lack of elevator) and we never agreed to it...but then she charged us the extra person fee as well as the room upgrade to have a twin and a queen..well if we had a room with a queen and a twin (which we didn't) why would we pay for the extra person fee as two people can fit in a queen and one in a twin...hotel just didn't have much to offer. when i told the receptionist i didn't want to be moved to a noisy room she goes yeah there's a bar behind us all of our rooms are really noisy and the shower head was literally so low on the wall. I'm 5'2 and I struggled using it...i honestly don't know how someone any taller than i am would have been able to utilize the room. staff was very unfriendly and the rooms needed major updating...so not worth the high price they charge."
743,Inn At Queen Anne,Seattle,2015-12-28T00:00:00Z,47.62332,-122.35542,2.0,The hotel heeds to be renovated. It does not have an elevator so be prepared to climb stairs. There were no amenities in the room. The shower dripped all night. The only positive thing I can say is the front desk staff were courteous and helpful. However even the great employee service isn't enough to overcome the other negatives.
744,Inn At Queen Anne,Seattle,2016-06-06T00:00:00Z,47.62332,-122.35542,3.0,The cold water wasn't working couple times.
745,Inn At Queen Anne,Seattle,2016-05-25T00:00:00Z,47.62332,-122.35542,4.0,"This is the kind of hotel that I rarely find, anymore. It is a lovely old brick building in a lovely neighborhood. Check in parking is limited. Hotel parking is a block away and unsecured (so, as a motorcycle tourer, I had trepidation). I needn't have worried--all was just fine. Staff were efficient and friendly. The room and amenities were aged but we'll kept and spotless. It is a bit noisy (neighbors and street) but that should be expected in this urban setting. In fact, I rather liked it--felt more connected. There are loads of great restaurants nearby. The whole experience gave good vibes. Shabby chic Old and inviting."
746,Inn At Queen Anne,Seattle,2016-02-02T00:00:00Z,47.62332,-122.35542,3.0,"Enjoyed my stay, older hotel with character. Great staff room clean and comfortable. Parking is an issue but that's for all of Seattle. Key Arena and Space needle just blocks away same with Restaurants and nightlife. No elevator stairs only 3 floors."
747,Inn At Queen Anne,Seattle,2016-04-22T00:00:00Z,47.62332,-122.35542,3.0,"We stayed for a week here and overall enjoyed it. Definitely old looking but was very clean. Kitchenette was nice to have as going out is pricey and we saved a little making our own breakfast. VERY LOUD, you can hear everything outside and your neighbors. Also the shower and toilet were very finicky, sometimes only the cold would work and other times only hot water unless you turned it on just right. We also had to fix our toilet 2x as the flush would fall off or get stuck. We were able to deal with the quirks fine though, I'd stay again despite it."
748,Inn At Queen Anne,Seattle,2016-07-25T00:00:00Z,47.62332,-122.35542,1.0,"The hotel is horrifically overpriced. They say pillow top mattresses in every room, but the beds are not comfortable. There is no hairdryer in the room - you have to ask for it - and no coffee maker. All housekeeping does to clean the room is make the bed. No fresh towels, no new shampoo/conditioner. People are in the courtyard talking loudly until all hours of the night, which makes the rooms very noisy, and the hotel has no policy against it. The air conditioning units are very loud, which does help drown out the sound. The hotel will charge an extra 30 per day for incidentals and not explain that policy at either check in or check out. Though they refund it, they need to explain that clearly."
749,Inn At Queen Anne,Seattle,2016-08-22T00:00:00Z,47.62332,-122.35542,4.0,Upon arrival it was an easy check in. I was pleasently suprised at the cleanliness. It was very comfortable. I took a strole down the street to the store. It was very peaceful. I did however have a little un expected company. A little mouse was wandering around. I went to the front desk they said they would call maintance. No one ever showed. The mouse went back to his own room and only appeared a few more times. His exit was in the corner of the closet.
750,Inn At Queen Anne,Seattle,2016-05-12T00:00:00Z,47.62332,-122.35542,5.0,"Only thug would be the bed was a little to hard for my, uncomfortable, ad the pillows kinda flat. But that personal preference. And maybe use some fabric softener for towels."
751,Inn At Queen Anne,Seattle,2016-06-19T00:00:00Z,47.62332,-122.35542,2.0,Hope you are strong enough to carry all bags upstairs yourself. No elevator or coffee or fan for the small bathroom. Convenient location however if you don't mind parking on the street.
752,Inn At Queen Anne,Seattle,2016-05-15T00:00:00Z,47.62332,-122.35542,3.0,"The staff was very help, nice and knowledgable. The facility is a bit run down, not the cleanest. A bit over priced for the size, amenities and quality of the room. Had no parking available, had to use a sister hotels parking and we had to carry and walk our luggage two blocks. No compensation or assistance for inconvenience. Valet parking was a joke, took us over half an hour to get open spot to drop car off with valet. Not worth 20 of parking!! If offer parking, should facilitate all of your own guests. Was there for a concert, excellent location for concert at the key arena and with walking distance of several restaurants."
753,Inn At Queen Anne,Seattle,2016-06-11T00:00:00Z,47.62332,-122.35542,4.0,"It was a nice view, close to everything like variety of food choices, Needle Space, EMP museum, Central Park, Garden and nice walking environment for evening walking."
754,Inn At Queen Anne,Seattle,2016-01-26T00:00:00Z,47.62332,-122.35542,2.0,Parking cost me extra. Cheaper parking around the block. There were many issue like a leaky faucet and noisy street traffic and Low wifi signal.
755,Inn At Queen Anne,Seattle,2016-04-28T00:00:00Z,47.62332,-122.35542,3.0,Great location a little noisy but that was not totally unexpected.
756,Inn At Queen Anne,Seattle,2016-05-27T00:00:00Z,47.62332,-122.35542,3.0,"The carpets need cleaning and the coffee is weak. Also, guests should be reminded to be quiet in the halls."
757,Inn At Queen Anne,Seattle,2016-08-24T00:00:00Z,47.62332,-122.35542,4.0,"It is only a 7 minute walk to the space needle,science museum,epm museum,gardens, and monorail that leaves you a 5 minute walk from pikes place. The only negative is that it has thin walls and noise tavels alot. And parking behind building looks a little sketchy"
758,Inn At Queen Anne,Seattle,2016-06-01T00:00:00Z,47.62332,-122.35542,5.0,I like this place - close to Arena and lots of restaurants. I've stayed there before and I will use again.
759,Inn At Queen Anne,Seattle,2016-06-15T00:00:00Z,47.62332,-122.35542,4.0,The hotel was clean and had character. The 1 soda vending machine is in the basement and although there was several choices of soda only one choice was stocked. The shower in our room would turn very hot or very cold while showering.
760,Inn At Queen Anne,Seattle,2016-07-12T00:00:00Z,47.62332,-122.35542,4.0,"Older hotel, but decent sized rooms, and very clean. Great staff ! Located near attractions."
761,Inn At Queen Anne,Seattle,2016-06-07T00:00:00Z,47.62332,-122.35542,3.0,"We needed a moderately priced hotel for 1 night in the downtown area. We choose the Queen Anne, because it was much more affordably priced than the other surrounding hotels. The rooms are older and smaller (and could use some renovation), but adequately met our needs for the night. Although, we didn't need it there was a kitchen and huge closet which had enough space to store our suitcases. The reception/lobby area was warm and inviting with jazz music being piped in and the front desk personnel was polite. I would recommend a room not facing the street side it was noisy at times."
762,Inn At Queen Anne,Seattle,2016-07-26T00:00:00Z,47.62332,-122.35542,3.0,Just to do tourist stuff in Seattle. fantastic location . Had a great time but parking was very hard. .. Photo is view from room
763,Inn At Queen Anne,Seattle,2016-06-24T00:00:00Z,47.62332,-122.35542,3.0,Disappointed in parking options but convenient being next to Seattle Center and for our purpose of travel.
764,Inn At Queen Anne,Seattle,2016-04-15T00:00:00Z,47.62332,-122.35542,3.0,"The good: It is walking distance to the theater district, the Spaceneedle, Seattle Center, and there are some great restaurants closeby. The hotel room was clean, a decent size and had a small kitchenette with a fridge and stove. The bad: The hotel is pretty old with few amenities. The room had single paned windows which let in sounds from the street."
765,Inn At Queen Anne,Seattle,2016-06-23T00:00:00Z,47.62332,-122.35542,3.0,The bed is as hard as a rock and I woke up from back pain and my husband got back pain too later in the week. I really like that there is a little kitchen but the oven didn't work at all. One window was completely covered by ivy so we couldn't use it. The other two windows were okay but we couldn't leave them open so we used the ac a lot. The staff was very friendly and had good recommendations for restaurants in walking distance. Our favorite part was the location because it is next to a market with amazing cheap dinners and lunches.
766,Inn At Queen Anne,Seattle,2016-04-21T00:00:00Z,47.62332,-122.35542,3.0,There was no elevator so we stayed on the first floor. There was quite a bit of street noise because of it. Not sure about upper floors.
767,Inn At Queen Anne,Seattle,2016-06-30T00:00:00Z,47.62332,-122.35542,1.0,This hotel looks nice from the outside but is very dated and old inside. The beds haven't been updated since the 70's. Paint is peeling off the walls. And no handicap access. We couldn't take a shower in our own room because you could have hot water or cold water but you couldn't have both at the same time. The front desk told us they knew about the problem and to let the water run for about 10 minutes to see if that helped.....it didn't.
768,Inn At Queen Anne,Seattle,2016-04-15T00:00:00Z,47.62332,-122.35542,3.0,"The front desk guy told my boyfriend he couldn't use the bathroom because the last guy laid a log in there. I was super unimpressed, not only by what was said, but his sassy attitude. The guy that checked us out in the morning was kind, and efficient. Otherwise, it was cheap and convenient for a same day booking on a Friday night in downtown Seattle"
769,Inn At Queen Anne,Seattle,2016-02-12T00:00:00Z,47.62332,-122.35542,4.0,"Really like this place! Only one negative... They hold the entire stay plus a bit more when you check in. Which was fine until we checked out and they charge you the bill, which was 460.00 but another 600.00 was held in addition. Didnt really like them tying up the money for another 3-5 days. It was okay for us but I know it could mess people up if they were on a tight budget. What if we had needed it for the rest of our trip or lost our cash... We travel ALOT and I have never had a hotel do this. Too bad because we really liked the place and the people. It is an older building but more spacious than the Hilton. Hope they rework this policy."
770,Inn At Queen Anne,Seattle,2016-05-04T00:00:00Z,47.62332,-122.35542,4.0,"The only negative thing I would have to say is that there is no outlet in the bathroom or anywhere near the bathroom which caused a slight inconvenience. Other than that, my stay was absolutely wonderful."

It's a 20 minute walk from the Space Needle area. From there we could catch the Monotail to downtown an Pike Market. This is an older hotel, but it is very comfortable and charming. The staff was very helpful and gave good advice about places to visit and eat."
773,Inn At Queen Anne,Seattle,2016-06-27T00:00:00Z,47.62332,-122.35542,2.0,"Staff was courteous and room was clean but everything else was a let down. If you want to stay in an antique hotel, this is the place. They patched it up as much as possible but imagine staying in a 50's vintage house. Also no elevator and parking was 25. The room was definitely not worth the high price I had to pay. The only great thing was the location downtown close to the Space Needle and the arena across the street."
774,Inn At Queen Anne,Seattle,2016-08-18T00:00:00Z,47.62332,-122.35542,1.0,"I drove up and the guy smoking and drinking outside should have been my first clue! The night manager then began making excuses for the neighborhood and telling me how happy she was not working hemp fest and how crazy it gets. Then the noise from the screaming drunk patrons interrupted ... that was my second clue. I walked up the stairs and opened the door to the hallway and the scent of marijuana made me gag... yes literally. Our room was the first door and the scent continued in the room. I looked for the AC and tried to turn it on and for 15 minutes it blew hot air so and I smelled the bed and it smelled like marijuana and I really could not stay there so I left hoping they could move me to another room. The manger was belligerent and did not even offer to move me and I told her I could not sleep in a room and on sheets that smelled of marijuana. She said that was all they had and I told her I would have to leave then and she got an attitude with me saying I would have to pay for the full time and I said it was a night cancellation fee and I did not cancel the room you put me in smells of marijuana, the noise of drunk stoned patrons and the lack of AC in the room to get the smell out was just not acceptable. She said to call the manager in the morning and she could correct it and checked me out charging me for 2 days and I refused to sign the receipt and left."
775,Inn At Queen Anne,Seattle,2016-05-22T00:00:00Z,47.62332,-122.35542,1.0,"It was the cheapest in the area (although still expensive)...but it was a horrible stay, we were able to cancel our reservations for the last 3 nights and able to get a hotel across the street. Ok. The place was completely outdated, which I could deal with, but it wasnt well kept and maintenance of any looked like it was done by someone who had no idea what they were doing. Such as the bathroom plumbing, there was no cold water, at all. There was very little water pressure, that meant the showers were scalding hot. The room smelled, the small Ac units did their job, but if it were summer I would doubt it. Honestly the worst hotel experience of my life."
776,Inn At Queen Anne,Seattle,2016-08-16T00:00:00Z,47.62332,-122.35542,5.0,"This is by far the BEST hotel we have ever visited. The Inn was built in 1928 as apartments and has been transformed into efficiency rooms. When you enter the lobby you will see lovely lighting fixtures and a decor that takes you back in time. Our room is HUGE. We have a separate kitchen with table, fridge, stove, microwave, utensils and pans. Huge walk-in closet and modern bathroom. A ceiling fan and AC kept us nice and cool. The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful. I love that you use an actual key to get in your room. You also get a key for the front door if you come back late at night. The bed has a pillowtop and comfy pillows. The Inn is within walking distance of the Space Needle and only a block away from Seattle Center. There is a great diversity of restaurants, coffee bars, shopping and bars all around. I have stayed in 4-star hotels and they don't compare to the Inn. We have found our go-to home in Seattle!!"

Our room contained a queen bed and then a twin bed and a little kitchen with a stove. The closet was huge, big enough that we were able to put our pack n play in there for our son to sleep in, so basically he had his own room which worked out great. He slept wonderfully. We walked to the park behind the key arena then to the space needle. The neighborhood was awesome!"

Some very prominent maintenance issues - leak/stain/holes in hallway ceiling, peeling paint and damaged wood fixtures. Many things could be quickly and affordably solved. If I'm paying 175+ per night, I'd think there should be a working toilet paper roll. No fan in bathroom and windows were painted shut, so...yeah. Regardless, the room was clean and the location could not be beat. Would stay again."

We were able to walk to all of the local attractions with ease. The age of this hotel is certainly showing - hard bed, small bathroom with plumbing issues... The one bright spot - plenty of HOT water."

However, the staff was very accommodating and willing to assist where needed. I was worried that it was in a bad part of town- however it was just fine, safe and friendly. Although I like newer rooms... I feel that for the price- it was a great value. It allowed me to be close enough for business and still experience some sites for my own pleasure- which were very close by. I loved that I could see the water from my room and could be there in a short walk."
794,Inn At Queen Anne,Seattle,2016-07-17T00:00:00Z,47.62332,-122.35542,3.0,The hotel was built in the 1930's and the inn shows some wear and tear. Beds were comfortable and area quiet. Good restaurants nearby. Close to the cruise ship pier 91 and the space needle. I would recommend the hotel if going on a cruise and one is arriving the day before the cruise ship departs.

Front lobby is on the building to the left as viewed from the street access. There is no free parking as street parking requires feeding the parking meter 1.50 every two hours. Or, you can pay to park in their little lot for 20 per day. The area is nice with plenty of restaurants and shops and even a high end Whole Foods type of grocery down the street. There is only one ice machine and is in the basement of the front lobby building. Of course our room was in the other building."

While I had grand plans to tour Seattle, I injured my back and couldn't do all I wanted. The desk clerk was tremendously helpful, carrying my suitcase up to my room since there's no elevator. Some of the fixtures show wear, but the room was quite comfortable, once I turned on the window AC unit. There's a nearby 24-hr pharmacy and grocery store, so I was able to get things I needed easily. Key Arena is right across the street, and the Space Needle is a relatively easy walking distance (though uphill). I'd love to stay here again when my back is healthy!"

Friendly staff, clean room, self-laundry is in the basement of the main building. No keycard here they go old-school with actual keys! Bed was super-comfortable. AC and ceiling fan kept us cool during a heat wave. The shower needs better water pressure but the water temperature was perfect."

Easy access to restaurants, bars, Markets, Seattle center and nearby bus stops or bike renting stop (pronto) to head downtown. Nothing special of this hotel besides the location.

Bathroom and sink area were not cleaned. Hair on walls, hair in sink, hair in tub, hair on soap dish. It was pretty gross. I was too tired to deal with it when I checked in, so I didn't complain while I was there, but definitely put a damper on an otherwise great stay. They let me have a late check out with no fuss, which was really nice since I was in town for a race and the drive back to Orlando was much more pleasant after getting clean.

Thankfully we had enough to drink at the concert to sleep through the disgusting smell. Who allows smoking in rooms anymore Time to upgrade your client base and refurbish that floor and the hotel to non-smoking. I had to wash even my clean clothes, just to get the smell out of them.

Since I was not happy about that, he then checked to see what he could do and found a room with a king bed. Kudos to him for that but the room must have had pets in it previously because every time I stood still on the carpet, something would bite me. I assume it must have been fleas so rather than go through the hassle of changing rooms, I did not stand still on the carpet and thankfully the critters didn't follow me home. I told the girl at the desk about the issue so hopefully the room was properly cleaned and treated. Shame on the pet owners who bring their bug infested pets into a hotel room making it worse for the next guest."

I found that very odd and rude. There was also a lot of noise in this hotel. I heard doors slamming and people talking until 2am. I also smelled smoke the entire time I was there. I'm not sure if it was coming from the vent in my bathroom or people walking down the hall. It was very strong in the stairwells (which I took when I could because the elevator was so slow)."

The only plus was it was relatively clean...except when checking if we had everything prior to check out we found a sock left from a previous guest.

Only one person working there that night. No blankets, pillows or sheets for the pull out bed. Pool was dirty and gross. Our room was discussing and very dirty! Good all over the floor! Bed was super hard, didn't sleep all night. Next morning the breakfast was good but no one taking care of it and keeping it fresh and stocked. The lady cooking was also the front desk person. Line for breakfast and no coffee, milk, sausage or eggs! Very disappointed and will never be back! They were trying to update the hotel but cut too many corners!"

The air-conditioning system didn't work right room was to hot. By far one of the worst hotels in have ever stayed at. Maybe some day it will be a better place if they change some of their staff.
1013,Solstice,Erie,2015-09-12T00:00:00Z,42.046699,-80.080429,2.0,"The 1st room and floor they gave us smelled like cigarettes, so the woman at the desk upgraded us to a suite on another floor. This room smelled of mold, the AC leaked, and the phone did not work. So another women at the desk switched us to another suite on another floor. This room was better just outdated and old. The power in the hotel kept going flicker on off, so we made sure to use the stairs not the elevator. The front desk staff were very friendly and did their best to make us comfortable."

This time we chose a different hotel because of the hotel. When checking in we noticed signs everywhere that stated pool was cold due to the heater getting fixed previously and that the pool was cold. If we would have known this we wouldn't have booked here. Next time we will go elsewhere not happy that my daughter didn't get to enjoy a swim before being laid up for the next 6 weeks

THE POOL WAS SO DIRTY THE KIDS COULDN'T SWIM, THE ROOMS HAD AN AWFUL SMELL, THE WATER AND COFFEE HAD A TERRIBLE TASTE, THE WIFI DID NOT WORK AT ALL UNLESS YOU GOT ON AT 3AM AND THEN IT WAS SLOWWWW, THE FREE BREAKFAST WAS OKAY NOTHING TO BRAG ABOUT, THE LOCATION WAS OKAY AND CLOSE ENOUGH TO EVERYTHING. ALL IN ALL WE WOULD NOT STAY HERE AGAIN"
1017,Solstice,Erie,2015-10-22T00:00:00Z,42.046699,-80.080429,2.0,Basic but clean. Absolutely no frills. A lot of road noise. Walls are thin and I could hear the people talking in the next room. Room smelled a little weird. Trash bags covered the hotel sign of the prior owner. Mattress and pillows very cheap and uncomfortable.

1023,Solstice,Erie,2015-07-11T00:00:00Z,42.046699,-80.080429,3.0,There is remodeling going on at this hotel. When I say that - even the sign had a garbage bag over it. (Luckily the GPS knew where to go). My daughter arrived before I did and checked us both in. When I arrived and went to my room it was marked non-smoking. I went to the desk (with my confirmation) to straighten it out. I was informed that the hotel was sold after I booked my room and it's now a non smoking hotel. I told her that was the only reason I booked the room. She got on her computer and found a room that had not been remodeled yet that was a former smoking room.

Some of the other guests were very loud, screaming and fighting in the hall and smoking in their room, causing smoke alarms to go off in the middle of the night, which was dealt with by staff immediately. Stayed here about a year ago before it switched over, total transformation. Breakfast was hot and fresh. Room was spotless.... More"
1025,Solstice,Erie,2016-07-31T00:00:00Z,42.046699,-80.080429,5.0,"We booked about 30 minutes before arrival, as we decided to stop for the night. When we got to the hotel, the room we booked wasn't available. The only room with the size bed we reserved that was available was an upgrade and they gave it to us willingly.The room was great! Breakfast the next morning was simple but delicious, and the remodeling that is going on in the lobby in no way negatively impacted our stay. It was great!"
1026,Solstice,Erie,2015-08-20T00:00:00Z,42.046699,-80.080429,1.0,The first room they sent us to had a strong smell of mold in it and asked it be changed. The rooms didn't look anything like it did on line. There were no laundry facilities. The person in the breakfast room was rude when asked a question about why the waffle maker wasn't working.
1027,Solstice,Erie,2016-07-22T00:00:00Z,42.046699,-80.080429,2.0,"Did not know the hotel was under repair. Pool closed early the night we checked in and kids couldn't use it. One main reason picked this hotel was for the pool. Another was breakfast. Breakfast was okay but they were out of everything. Juice machine broken, had to ask for silverware and cups, sausage took forever to be replenished. Ok for a quick stay over but overall not at all impressed."
1029,Solstice,Erie,2016-02-28T00:00:00Z,42.046699,-80.080429,5.0,"Good location near restaurants, shopping indoor water park. Friendly staff. Good breakfast."
1030,Solstice,Erie,2015-08-22T00:00:00Z,42.046699,-80.080429,3.0,This hotel is no longer a country inn and suites. It is Solstice. When we arrived there was noone at the front desk. Had to go find. She was doing something at the pool. The pool water was chilly and was not open in the a m per posted hours. The breakfast was so so at best unless you like sausage gravy and biscuits. No butter. No cream for coffee. Hopefully this is just attributable to change in ownership. The beds were good though the room was okay and the staff tried. They were just understaffed.
1031,Solstice,Erie,2016-03-25T00:00:00Z,42.046699,-80.080429,2.0,"We stayed at this hotel recently when we had a family emergency. Overall if you are just looking for a place to sleep it is not that bad. However, if you are expecting anything else, this place is lacking. When we arrived there was no one at the desk. After we stood there for a couple of minutes someone shouted out that they would be there in a minute. The staff was not rude but I would say they were indifferent. We went up to our room and my brother and his family went to his. Our room was ok however, my brother had to immediately return to the desk and have his room switched. When he entered the original room the beds were not on their frames and it looked like the furniture was being moved around. His new room had no towels. The front desk informed us that they were out of towels. The pool water was a freezing but the room was 100 degrees. There were no towels at the pool either. We were told that hopefully there would be towels in the morning. The shower squealed when it was on and went from extremely hot to freezing. This was tons of fun with children who were trying to shower. The carpet in the hall and the main stair case was never vacuumed and disgusting. I know they never vacuumed it because we were there for 2 nights and it never got cleaned. As other reviews have stated breakfast was nothing to brag about. I would NEVER stay at this hotel again. For an extra couple of we could have stayed at the Econo Lodge right next door. It is a much nicer hotel."
1032,Solstice,Erie,2016-07-05T00:00:00Z,42.046699,-80.080429,2.0,"Just not the best hotel. They are currently doing a remodel but it still needs work. Poor breakfast, and bad mattress."
1033,Solstice,Erie,2015-09-04T00:00:00Z,42.046699,-80.080429,1.0,The hotel was disgusting. The carpet was stained and the paint on the walls did not match. It smelled terrible and was musty and moldy.
1034,Solstice,Erie,2015-09-29T00:00:00Z,42.046699,-80.080429,2.0,Thought I booked at Country Inn and Suites.... Got there and under new owners Not very personal at checkin Waited long time
1035,Solstice,Erie,2015-08-13T00:00:00Z,42.046699,-80.080429,4.0,"Staying at this hotel was a mid-point stop over, for me and my friends. One of our party is sensitive to chlorine, and our room was right next to the pool. However, the AC unit worked well enough that it was not noticed. Continental breakfast was good. I would suggest additional and convenient places for debris. Thanks to the attendant's suggestion to add more waffle batter, my waffle was full and fluffy. We would consider staying here again."
1036,Solstice,Erie,2015-12-04T00:00:00Z,42.046699,-80.080429,4.0,"We enjoyed our stay, but were very disappointed the pool was not available. The pool was one of the selling points. My daughter was very upset."
1037,Solstice,Erie,2016-04-27T00:00:00Z,42.046699,-80.080429,1.0,It honestly was quite disappointing to me. The pool was out of service there was no guest laundry the ice machine was out of order. It's honestly a good thing I was on business and not vacation. This visit was not good at all hopeful once they fully remodel it will be better.
1038,Solstice,Erie,2015-08-21T00:00:00Z,42.046699,-80.080429,4.0,Had a great time felt safe at all times at the hotel if you need to just get away for a few days go for it you would not be sorry
1039,Solstice,Erie,2016-03-11T00:00:00Z,42.046699,-80.080429,4.0,"The check in and check out process was easy and convenient. My biggest complaint would be that the breakfast was low/out of a lot of things, and when we notified the woman at the front desk, she didn't seem to have any concern for it, and then told us that it would take too long for the pancake batter to set."
1040,Solstice,Erie,2016-07-05T00:00:00Z,42.046699,-80.080429,3.0,Overall the stay was good. The only drawbacks were that the hotel is under significant renovation in rooms and the lobby. So they did not have a public computer for us to use to print out our boarding passes. But the room itself was very good. Comfortable and clean.
1041,Solstice,Erie,2015-08-23T00:00:00Z,42.046699,-80.080429,3.0,"We were looking for an overnight place to stay while visiting the local amusement park with two kids. We picked this hotel because of the great rate and the fact that it had an indoor pool. The staff was friendly and the room was as advertised. But the pool - Oh, my! One look at the color of the water and we were out of there. It did not appear to have been cleaned or filtered in a few days and there was an unpleasant odor. There is no hot tub in the pool area, either (the online picture of the pool had a picture of a separate area behind the pool with a hand rail, which I thought to be a hot tub. I don't see that picture of the pool anymore, though)."
1042,Solstice,Erie,2016-02-16T00:00:00Z,42.046699,-80.080429,3.0,"The price of the room was great.the hotel met our needs, big room, pool, and Continental breakfast. It wasn't the cleanest, and the breakfast was ok at best. Out of orange juice, apple juice was watered down, and the hot coffee and hot water were both lukewarm. The hotel is in the process of being renovated, so maybe after its done, more detail will be given to the cleanliness."
1043,Solstice,Erie,2015-09-05T00:00:00Z,42.046699,-80.080429,4.0,"This is our second stay at this hotel! Now it has recently been taken over by Solstice. So there is possibly renovations in plans I am unaware of. The hotel is clean. With the exception of the pool. I was very disappointed, that was the exact reason we booked this hotel because it has an indoor pool. The staff is friendly, courteous - even helped me connect my phone to their wifi! The bed / mattress was not very nice, could feel the springs move and you adjusted positions. I wouldn't say I wouldn't stay there again because the price was reasonable, they have a great choice for breakfast there and it's convenient to Peach Street. I just hope with the switch they make some upgrades."
1044,Solstice,Erie,2016-02-26T00:00:00Z,42.046699,-80.080429,5.0,"Was there for work and couldn't ask for a better place . BREAKFAST,was perfect and the staff were incredible . Perfect, no complaints at all."
1045,Solstice,Erie,2015-07-18T00:00:00Z,42.046699,-80.080429,2.0,"When we booked this room a couple of months ago, it was a Country Inn and Suites - it had changed to a Solstice by the date of our check-in and subsequently all of the Country Inn and Suites signage etc. had been covered up making the hotel very hard to find from the highway (we drove past it twice) The condition of the hotel was a little old - hoping that the new company will do some sprucing up - torn screens, dirty windows, stained carpets, general musty smell throughout, tired landscaping - The rooms were clean enough but just not up to the standards of other hotels in this same price point."
1046,Solstice,Erie,2015-08-28T00:00:00Z,42.046699,-80.080429,4.0,Great Stay!!!
1047,Solstice,Erie,2016-06-22T00:00:00Z,42.046699,-80.080429,2.0,"We understood about the construction. However, the staff during the day apparently cannot get off of their cell phones to speak to their customers. The breakfast options were the worst continental breakfast options I have seen. There were 3 mini muffins that I did not have because I wanted to make them available for my kids. I think there might have been 2 bagles and a couple pieces bread too. Waffles were the only hot food option available. The room was nice and clean. Service was just not good."
1048,Solstice,Erie,2016-05-02T00:00:00Z,42.046699,-80.080429,2.0,"The room given to us check in smelled badly of pet odor. I immediately went to front desk received another room. The staff was very friendly accommodating. We were upgraded to a room w/Jacuzzi tub. Unfortunately it didn't work. There were lots of light bulbs missing from light fixtures. All in all it was pretty clean, a comfortable bed hours of check out breakfast were more accommodating than other places I've stayed at."
1049,Solstice,Erie,2015-08-14T00:00:00Z,42.046699,-80.080429,3.0,Our room smelled like smoke but beds were comfortable. Breakfast buffet understaffed and crowded. Front desk attendant not very nice.
1050,Solstice,Erie,2016-03-19T00:00:00Z,42.046699,-80.080429,5.0,overnite trip to erie for shopping then splash lagoon the indoor pool was very dim lite and cold......like 70 degrees cold water IF that.......that was depressing since we booked it so the kids could swim at nite :(.
1051,Solstice,Erie,2016-07-21T00:00:00Z,42.046699,-80.080429,5.0,Late arrival. Great friendly staff. Easy check-in. Clean room. Very quiet.
1052,Solstice,Erie,2015-05-16T00:00:00Z,42.046699,-80.080429,2.0,"The hotel and our room smelled a little off, we had to buy an air freshener to make it smell better. There was a broken lamp in our room and we had to ask for more pillows for our king bed when we got there. The hotel is under construction but all the work being done didn't look like it would help much. The pool needed to be cleaned and the key card slot to get into the pool area was broken. The continental breakfast wasn't great but that's what you get when it's free."
1053,Solstice,Erie,2016-05-06T00:00:00Z,42.046699,-80.080429,5.0,"This is my second visit to this hotel here in Erie for business. Both times involved late arrivals but I was checked in and settled in my exceptionally clean room in less than 5 minutes. My business travel puta me in this town often and after staying in most all of the hotels available this hits my number one every time. Convenient to most everything in minutes(downtown, mall, Presque Isle , Casino etc) even with the road construction. Would stay here and recommend to everyone as most consistent to task and always the cleanest regardless of the name or money spent!"

The hotel was definitely being renovated and the pictures of what it will look like in the future look nice and clean, however... they are definitely still renovating and in the very early stages of that."
1055,Solstice,Erie,2015-10-07T00:00:00Z,42.046699,-80.080429,2.0,The faucet was very shaky. Breakfast was...meh
1056,Solstice,Erie,2015-07-17T00:00:00Z,42.046699,-80.080429,5.0,"we had a 2 day stay at country inn and suites. went for roar on the shore bike rally. we had a wonderful stay! excellent breakfast! our room was very quiet, even being across from the pool. hotel was renovating, as i believe they are no long country inn and suites. our overall stay was very good! no complaints!"
1057,Solstice,Erie,2016-02-19T00:00:00Z,42.046699,-80.080429,3.0,"The Breakfast was BAD! We stayed last year when it was Country Inn Suites now the Solstice. Went down for Breakfast and things were empty. second trip and they had eggs that were way over done and sausage the same. no fruit, cereal was a off brand and nothing I would want. No pastries, no toast, and the juice machine did not work. They did have jugs of off brand juice sitting out. We did not eat and went out for breakfast. The lobby was very slippery, no signs of slippery when wet. Hope there get it together as that might be our last stay. On the better side of things the price was not bad."
1058,Solstice,Erie,2016-05-15T00:00:00Z,42.046699,-80.080429,3.0,"Friendly staff, quiet stay close to the shopping and restaurants."

Room stunk of years of smoke filthy carpets, my son had to have three asthma treatments in one night. No other rooms available we would've left. Got there late after being at amusement park all day. Was close enough to amusements. But very dirty hotel. Hotel renovation was that they've taken out the hot tub and the pool is disgusting and green and we do not want to get in it. Extremely disappointing! Hotel said they could not attempt to refund me anything because I had paid for it on Expedia"

1061,Solstice,Erie,2015-08-15T00:00:00Z,42.046699,-80.080429,2.0,Price high for type of hotel. Picture of pool online deceiving much smaller. Hotel still being repaired
1062,Solstice,Erie,2016-03-24T00:00:00Z,42.046699,-80.080429,3.0,"Hotel was clean and quiet. Breakfast was terrible. We arrived 30 minutes after it was to begin. There was no milk for the cereal and they offered all starches- French toast sticks, waffles, bagels, English muffins, dry cereal. No fruit no yogurt."
1063,Solstice,Erie,2016-07-13T00:00:00Z,42.046699,-80.080429,1.0,"Was very dirty, the only good thing was the location very nice restaurants and shopping near by."

1070,Solstice,Erie,2015-07-16T00:00:00Z,42.046699,-80.080429,1.0,"We could not find the name of the hotel. It was in the process of being renovated, the outside signs taken down, screens on upper floors partially torn out. Add to this a convention of Harley motorcycle owners. It was much less than I anticipated."
1071,Solstice,Erie,2016-07-25T00:00:00Z,42.046699,-80.080429,1.0,Room was dirty and hotel staff was rude.
1072,Solstice,Erie,2015-11-18T00:00:00Z,42.046699,-80.080429,5.0,We stayed the night during the week. Of the staff people we talked to they were all very friendly. The hotel is starting to show its age and use but it appears that the new owners are starting to work on that and improve the overall appearance of the place. We have stayed here many times over the years and have always had a good experience and as long as things stay the same with the service and price we will stay here many more times.
1073,Solstice,Erie,2016-08-15T00:00:00Z,42.046699,-80.080429,1.0,"I asked for a room with a sofa bed,I confirmed it on line .I check in at 4:00,Early enough,only to be told that they didn,t have any rooms left with Queen bed,s and sofa bed.He did check my reservation and sure enough that what I ASKED FOR.I was told I could get a roll away,only they came and said no rollaways,This was my time with my grandchildren,two slept on the floor I WASN,T HAPPY."
1074,Solstice,Erie,2016-07-27T00:00:00Z,42.046699,-80.080429,3.0,"This hotel is being renovated while open for business. I don't mind the construction in the lobby, but the rooms are in drastic need of an overhaul. The beds in our first room squeeked so much we had to ask for another room. The beds still squeeked, but not as bad. Although this room seemed to have a renovated bathroom, the walls desperately needed a coat of paint. The pool was down the hall, but the door was propped open making our room very humid. The front desk staff were very friendly, even though they had to field many complaints."
1075,Solstice,Erie,2016-08-22T00:00:00Z,42.046699,-80.080429,4.0,They are remodeling so what they've done so far looks great. Our room was freshly painted but the bed spread was dirty and had stains on it and the bathroom had hair in the shower and on the toilet. The Windows had hand prints all over them and people were outside in the parking lot very late being super loud for over an hour. The price was great and it smelled clean. If you're just going for somewhere to sleep i would recommend this hotel because overall it was nice but if you're looking to stay somewhere to be in the room it's probably not for you.
1076,Solstice,Erie,2015-06-07T00:00:00Z,42.046699,-80.080429,5.0,Hotel was renovating but there wsd no noise in my room. Staff was wonderful!
1077,Solstice,Erie,2016-04-15T00:00:00Z,42.046699,-80.080429,1.0,"Getting into our hotel we noticed the hallways were dirty. The room was worse. Thick stiff visible dust on curtains and light fixtures. Corners of carpeting was never vacuumed. The couch had filth between the cushions - never cleaned. I asked for the GM the next morning to discuss the filth, but there was not one available. I was told... More"
1078,Solstice,Erie,2016-07-25T00:00:00Z,42.046699,-80.080429,2.0,Continental Breakfast was pretty much non existent
1079,Solstice,Erie,2016-07-22T00:00:00Z,42.046699,-80.080429,2.0,Not great. Hotel very worn. Inside doesn't match outside. Would not stay again.
1080,Solstice,Erie,2016-08-27T00:00:00Z,42.046699,-80.080429,2.0,Disappointed. Thought it was redone from website.
1081,Solstice,Erie,2015-07-06T00:00:00Z,42.046699,-80.080429,2.0,"On our way to the hotel we called to double check what time we could check-in. A woman answered the phone Solstice and I stated I had the wrong number. She asked if I was looking for the Country Suites and I stated that I was, she replied that the hotel was sold about two weeks ago. It would have been nice to know this, because they are under renovation and things were very dusty and outdated. I understand all of this is normal for renovation but it really affected my allergies and I was congested the whole time I was there. Also they were doing construction in the room next to us so that was a little annoying. The ceiling was coming down in our bathroom, and the shower barely drained, it was like you were taking a bath while showering. Staff at the front desk were very nice the guy in the kitchen was not all that nice. And the breasfast was ok at best. Probably won't stay here again or for a very long time if ever again."
1082,Solstice,Erie,2015-06-02T00:00:00Z,42.046699,-80.080429,3.0,Construction and renovation going on. Definitely needs updating. Still charged regular rates. Comfortable bed and housekeeping service nice.
1083,Solstice,Erie,2015-06-20T00:00:00Z,42.046699,-80.080429,1.0,The hotel is under major renovation. No outside amenities are available. Hotel staff pointed to a bench in the parking lot next to caution tape and dumpster for us to sit outside at. Very disappointing!!!!!
1084,Solstice,Erie,2015-05-06T00:00:00Z,42.046699,-80.080429,4.0,"Just a quick overnight while passing through the area. Comfortable beds, clean, quiet, enjoyable breakfast."
1085,Solstice,Erie,2016-08-10T00:00:00Z,42.046699,-80.080429,2.0,"The outside was done first drawing you in. Under construction as you walk in and go to the elevator, which had tape over the 1 (first floor button). Floor as you enter was half done making it dangerous. Everything is old on the inside. Our room had peeling wallpaper. The shower handle is nasty to deal with. Way too hard to pull shower button, which was left in the on mode when we got there. Cleaning person needs to make sure it is down. The wifi kept going off so we finally gave up."
1086,Solstice,Erie,2016-08-24T00:00:00Z,42.046699,-80.080429,2.0,I will never stay there again!!
1087,Solstice,Erie,2016-10-28T00:00:00Z,42.046699,-80.080429,2.0,Air conditioner did not work properly. TV remote did not work all the time. Beds had to be really old. Courtesey continental breakfast was a joke.
1088,Solstice,Erie,2016-09-17T00:00:00Z,42.046699,-80.080429,4.0,They where still renovating to the new hotel. It will be nice once it is done. Beds were not really comfortable. We asked for towels for the pool and they gave us bath mats.
1089,Solstice,Erie,2016-08-20T00:00:00Z,42.046699,-80.080429,4.0,Hotel is being renovated but overall a good stay. Water pressure could've been better along with drains were a little slow.
1090,Solstice,Erie,2016-08-27T00:00:00Z,42.046699,-80.080429,1.0,"DO NOT STAY HERE!!! BED BUGS!!! They gave us an already occupied room, then our second room had bedbugs in it, the manager confirmed that we were not the first couple this month to find them. My mom's room had cockroaches. Everything is dirty and the staff aren't very friendly."
1091,Solstice,Erie,2015-06-17T00:00:00Z,42.046699,-80.080429,2.0,"Old lumpy bed spread. Checked in at 5:30 pm, room not ready. Free breakfest old and stale muffins and bagels. We choose to eat else where."
1092,Solstice,Erie,2016-08-27T00:00:00Z,42.046699,-80.080429,1.0,Wifi did not work. Breakfast was really bad. Gym and laundry were out of order. Neighborhood was a congested highway exit.
1093,Solstice,Erie,2015-06-10T00:00:00Z,42.046699,-80.080429,4.0,"Hotel is conveniently located just a bit off the interstate. Currently undergoing some exterior renovations, nothing that woke us up early or anything. First room they gave us hadn't been cleaned. Slight annoyance after traveling all day with 2 toddlers! Beds and pillows were comfortable. Breakfast was fine, not great. Nice place, nothing that would stop me from staying there again!"
1094,Solstice,Erie,2016-10-04T00:00:00Z,42.046699,-80.080429,2.0,"I was surprised to see the pool was closed for the whole stay. Aslo whatever co structuin they were doing, didnt seem to be moving. I was there for 5 days and not once did i see a construction crew. Also noise was aweful, on both sides. One side was a highway and the other was busy road. The mattress were terrible. Just not worth the money."
1095,Solstice,Erie,2016-09-30T00:00:00Z,42.046699,-80.080429,5.0,I enjoyed my stay with my family it was clean bed comfy close by ever thing I need.

I thought this hotel was very nice and the staff were super resourceful. The hotel is currently being renovated, but that did not affect my room. The room was very spacious but I must admit the beds were terrible. Other than that everything worked out well."
1097,Solstice,Erie,2015-05-21T00:00:00Z,42.046699,-80.080429,4.0,Overall good value for the money. In the process of being updated.

Room was clean, bed & pillow were comfortable, nice toiletries and towels. Check in was a little slow, but staff in the lobby were nice. However, the AC unit is loud & in the room. The mini fridge is somewhat noisy. And the toilet kept running every 10 minutes (loudest filling toilet ever). And the headboard had seen some damage (fake leather). The location is great though. Short walk to harbor area, lots of restaurants, etc."

Our room and the hotel was well kept, clean and the decor tasteful.The 5 p.m. manager hosted wine tasting is an excellent way to return to the hotel after a nice day out to see the sites and touring. It was also a great ice breaker to meet other guests (or not).To top it off this particular property is perfectly located on King Street in historic Alexandria surrounded by shops and excellent choices of restaurants.We will definitely stay here again and will recommend to friends."
1104,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Alexandria,2015-04-06T00:00:00Z,38.80474,-77.04455,5.0,"The hotel is right in the heart of Old Town Alexandria on King Street. Shops, bakeries and wonderful restaurants lined the street. The 1 mile walk to the Metro gave us plenty of opportunities to window shop. The staff was great. Our room was a little on the small side, but for 2 nights we were more than satisfied. Highly recommended."

We live in Baltimore so the journey was short.  I love this hotel and its lovely staff, great wine reception, dog-friendliness.  We enjoyed the large pool and sat in front of the reception fire place to warm up and meet interesting guests."
1106,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Alexandria,2016-06-01T00:00:00Z,38.80474,-77.04455,4.0,"We chose this hotel because Kimpton's have a great reputation and they are pet friendly. Upon arrival (around 9pm) we were disappointed that there was no door staff/valet etc so we ended up taking in the luggage ourselves. When the bellman did see me they didn't offer to help. Check-in was quick and front desk girl was very friendly, greeted Dori by name and offered her a pet package. The room was large and comfortable but there were some areas where you can see the hotel is showing some wear and tear. Overall still very good. All the amenities of a Kimpton including 4pm Kids Hour, 5pm wine hour and most importantly for us Pet Friendly. The hotel was very busy as it was Memorial Day weekend so the restaurant and room service had delays but that's to be expected. I would choose this hotel again especially for the proximity of being in the middle of Old Town, several blocks from the water front and in the midst of amazing restaurants like Restaurant Eve."

The only issue was checkout...they overcharged me for parking. It wasn't listed on final receipt and I would've never known if I didn't check my credit card statement (this wasn't the credit card holding charge). Quickly resolved, but still a hassle and the reason for less than 5 stars"

We were settled in our room in less than 10 minutes.  When I couldn't connect to wifi, a call to the front desk resulted in a knock on our door within two minutes.

When we are together, it's convenient to everything we need to get to, our old neighborhood, good restaurants and the major highways.This past weekend, there were a lot of little kids and dogs, I guess because it was a holiday weekend.  We heard dogs barking and kids crying, didn't bother us too much since it was during the day, if it disturbed our sleep this review might have had a different ending."
1122,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Alexandria,2014-03-21T00:00:00Z,38.80474,-77.04455,4.0,"This hotel is located in Old Town, Alexandria, VA. It is a renovated older hotel but the rooms were quite nice with marble sink and tile in the bath and nicely done d��cor. The hotel offers free shuttle service from Reagan International, but it only runs every hour. However, if you call the hotel they will let you know where and when to meet the shuttle. They offer complementary coffee and tea each morning and a wine bar each evening although we did not use the latter. There are many restaurants near the hotel including a very nice French caf�� next door. If you are a Kimpton rewards member, you can even receive a coupon good for $10 worth of items from the mini-bar in your room. The only negative was that the hotel is about a mile from the King St. Metro stop which provides the quickest and least expensive access to Washington, D.C.All things considered we would definitely consider staying there again during future visits."

Kimpton's ability to identify quality individuals from diverse backgrounds and then have a top notch traing program is reflected in each stay.

1127,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Alexandria,2015-09-30T00:00:00Z,38.80474,-77.04455,4.0,Great hotel in great location but expensive rooms and parking. Could have stayed a few blocks west on King street for $100 less a night had I known that bus service on King street is free and frequent. The two beds in our room where very narrow for two and who wants to sleep in separate beds?

1129,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Alexandria,2014-04-16T00:00:00Z,38.80474,-77.04455,5.0,"Alexandria on yksi niistä harvinaisista USAn kaupungeista, joissa väki kulkee kadulla. Kaupunki on eräänlainen vanhan ajan elävä museo, pikku putiikkeja ja ravintoloita pääkadulla. Samalla kadulla on tämä Hotelli Monaco, joka on hyvin persoonallinen ja viehättävä. Saimme ullakkokerroksen tilavan huoneen ja viihdyimme hyvin."
1130,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Alexandria,2015-11-10T00:00:00Z,38.80474,-77.04455,4.0,Overall we were pleased with our stay. The only downfall was that we had asked to be notified once our room was ready we had arrived about an hour before check in. When we contacted hotel staff around 45 minutes after allowed check in time we were told our room had been ready. Very frustrating on a cold rainy day when we just wanted to get settled.
1131,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Alexandria,2014-07-14T00:00:00Z,38.80474,-77.04455,5.0,This was a perfect base camp for touring DC. The metro station was within walking distance and a trolley was also available for getting to and from the metro. On the way to the metro station are lots of unique shops and restaurants. The area was totally safe for walking. The hotel is very close to the waterfront and the Torpedo Factory Art Center and the street entertainment in that area. Located on King Street this is a beautiful area to come back to after the bustle of DC. I hope to return again next year and will definitely stay in this hotel. Wish we had had more time. Highly recommend this beautiful hotel.

It's within walking distance of everything, the staff was very attentive and the rooms had a very nice charm to them. The only (small) issue we had is that AC unit was a bit loud - but since we are getting to the warmer days, it is expected that the unit needs to work hard to keep the room at a certain temperature. We thought it was really convenient that they provided little items that are easily forgotten: toothbrush/paste, phone charger, etc - upon request."
1138,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Alexandria,2014-04-27T00:00:00Z,38.80474,-77.04455,2.0,"Wasn't informed of $27 parking fee at time of booking, found out about that at check in. Room seemed closed in and dark, needs updating. Shower curtain was dirty, looked like someone blew their nose on it. Stained throw pillow and towel. Mattress was horribly uncomfortable, both myself and my wife spent a restless night. Forget the gym, the weight set is too complicated for a good workout and of the 5 pieces of cardio equipment, 1 functioned properly. The overall area had little to offer, unless you are into art. Homeless people were sleeping in doorways 30 feet from the doors of the hotel in the morning. Would not recommend this hotel to anyone. Wish we hadn't wasted our time and money on this hotel. When we informed the staff of the condition of our room, we were met with an oh. Thanks for nothing."
1139,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Alexandria,2016-08-08T00:00:00Z,38.80474,-77.04455,4.0,"This hotel is perfectly situated in Old Town Alexandria, VA   It is in the heart of town next to many restaurants and historic places.  With a rollaway bed and two double beds, my sons and a friend were easily accommodated in one room.  Always a pleasure to be at this site.  Some very small updates in the room do need to be done."

Not only are the rooms comfortable and tastefully decorated, but the service is fantastic. The lobby is the ""place to be,"" with plenty of action, wine hour, and coffee/tea in the mornings. The location is perfect for me as well, with an unending supply of great restaurants and bars within walking distance. I also like the small touches in the room, like a hair dryer, extra space, and robes."
1141,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Alexandria,2014-04-16T00:00:00Z,38.80474,-77.04455,5.0,"We drove into town for the Cherry Blossoms Festival in D.C., but didn't want to stay in $300+ hotels in the city...that's where Monaco provided the much needed relaxing atmosphere for this one-night stay and all the amenities and comfort that one might need. Awesome shower and comfy bed (two of my critical features), as well as location in the middle of Alexandria's shopping & restaurant district made this stay very memorable. Helpful staff at the front desk was a pleasant bonus, as well."
1142,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Alexandria,2014-07-07T00:00:00Z,38.80474,-77.04455,4.0,Parking is cheaper across the street.

Fomos embora sem que nada fosse resolvido.Tivemos indisposição após um jantar no restaurante do hotel.Por essas razões, a estadia acabou não sendo satisfatória."

We stayed in a double bed guestroom and had plenty of space. The bathroom was spacious and very clean. The pool area had plenty of windows that opened up and the fresh air was nice. I would highly recommend this hotel to couples and families.
1145,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Alexandria,2016-03-18T00:00:00Z,38.80474,-77.04455,5.0,"From the time we walked into the hotel until we left with our bags after check out, the staff at this location was nothing less than fantastic! They made us feel important and addressed any concern we had with immediate attention. I was filling out a survey about the hotel, and left a less than satisfied mark on the questionnaire. Within 5 minutes, I received a call from the front desk and an email. My problem? We were 20 mins away from where our plans were. Even though it had nothing to do with them, this hotel was all about making our visit enjoyable. Kudos to the front desk, cleaning staff, and everyone else that works at this place!"
1146,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Alexandria,2015-06-07T00:00:00Z,38.80474,-77.04455,5.0,Lovely boutique hotel that is located in heart of old Alexandria.

Comfortable and beautiful accommodations with a very friendly staff.  Whenever I need to be in DC, I choose to stay in this hotel and I look forward to returning.  King Street has restaurants and shops, CVS and Dunkin Donuts...the trolley is available to go to the waterfront and it is just beautiful. Upon arrival, I was greeted by a very sweet and professional check-in staff member and given a token for a beverage because I had just missed cocktail hour.  How nice.  Thank you again."

1153,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Alexandria,2014-08-09T00:00:00Z,38.80474,-77.04455,4.0,"A 4 star rating tells you that a hotel has a keen eye for details and unexpected pleasures and smiles are expected. That is not this hotel. I booked because of experience with Kimpton hotels in other cities. This one does not meet the Kimpton standard. Examples: Showerhead that stays in one position (straight down because of faulty bracket), toilet that runs and hums long after the flush (don't think that's a feature), a totally dysfunctional internet, which they acknowledge was on the blink. Overall, the hotel just needs some management attention and it could easily be brought up to standard 4 star. It is not at the moment a 4 star."
1154,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Alexandria,2015-06-05T00:00:00Z,38.80474,-77.04455,3.0,"It started poorly. The shuttle went right by us at the airport. The hotel was quick to suggest we take a taxi , which they reimbursed us for.  We were early but they graciously showed us to our room.the room was rather small and a little scruffy. They give us another room it was somewhat better but the bed was almost certainly not a queen and the pillows were very thick and hard. the staff was good and the location is great"

We had no idea what we were getting into being from Las Vegas and booking sight unseen. Our daughter's joined us from VA and NC and loved everything! It was so easy to hop on the water taxi, trolley and Metro to DC without the high price. We could not have asked for a better stay. Also, dog friendly."
1156,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Alexandria,2016-09-17T00:00:00Z,38.80474,-77.04455,5.0,Lovely hotel that has a staff that always goes beyond the ordinary to make your stay special. Don't miss the free wine reception at five!  A great place to meet your fellow travelers.  Take on the pool of you have time.  Lots to see and do on King Street!  The hotel has its own fleet of bikes.  Take a ride down to Mt Vernon!  Or take a boat ride to National Harbor.
1157,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Alexandria,2015-02-03T00:00:00Z,38.80474,-77.04455,3.0,"this is obviously the hipster hotel option in Old Town and while the hotel looks lovely and is decorated nicely I was very underwhelmed.I arrived on a totally freezing windy night, I saw two door guys standing inside the door watching me take my bags out and they just stood there.The don't mention self park and automatically valet'd my car. When I called for my car, I was told 5-10 minutes by the desk clerk. I went to the lobby in 10 and sat there for 20 more minutes. Not one staff member asked if they could help me or if I needed my car as I sat with my yellow ticket in hand. When I finally went to the desk to ask it was still a further 10 minutes before my car was brought up. I would have been happy to self park, if only I had been aware of the availability. You can exit the room and go straight to your car from the main elevators.The room was freezing, the unit made so much noise that it woke me up every time it cycled on and off. There were no extra blankets available in the room and so I spent my first night awake and freezing. I asked via a note the next day for housekeeping to leave an extra. The fried was also loud. I was next to the elevators which pinged all night. There���s no sound proofing and you can hear every conversation happening in the hallway. I used to think I was one of those youngish types who would frequent this type of hotel but I guess not as I'd be considerate not to make my evening plans loudly outside someone's room at 11PM."
1158,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Alexandria,2015-10-24T00:00:00Z,38.80474,-77.04455,3.0,"The hotel is located in a great location, lots of restaurants, bars, and cool shops. The hotel lobby was very cozy and the complementary glass of wine every evening was a nice touch. The room size was impressive but unfortunately the bed was very uncomfortable. I can usually sleep on just about anything, but actually woke up every morning with a sore back. Also, one day I returned to find the housekeeping staff had cleaned the room but left the door open. Very disappointing. The restaurant was average, it seems like the focus is on the famous chef's name and maybe not the food. Overall though, the staff was very helpful."
1159,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Alexandria,2014-01-14T00:00:00Z,38.80474,-77.04455,5.0,We found a public parking garage within 2 blocks of the hotel that charged $4 per day.

This was one of those such stays.  Available parking was reasonable, with in/out privs and no penalty.  The staff was very friendly, and helpful.  Their food recommendations were outstanding.  The location was perfect, near plenty of food and shopping and easy to get to.  The room was very quiet, and spotless.  Kimpton always does a great job.

The elevators well decorated. Marble throughout the hotel. Very impressive. However, after returning from a wonderful day on the town, having dinner and a few drinks, this is where our stay turned sour. Unbeknown to us, the room air conditioner wasn't working well at keeping the room cool! After looking at the room temperature control, the climate settings only allow a range from 65 degrees and a high of 73 Sweating all night! Horrible night sleep! Ceiling fan would have helped. For the price, I thought someone would have checked to see if we were comfortable. We decided to relocate elsewhere. Very disappointed."

The staff is ever present and helpful. The only downside to it was that the restaurant was short staffed one morning so we decided to go to another nearby spot for breakfast. We later learned from a bartender that one of the wait staff is pregnant and had been sick several times lately. And the bar closes early. There were quite a few people still in it when they made last call around 11 I believe. There is a wine happy hour every day from 5-6 in the lobby. One of the pourers actually remembered what I and my wife drank the night before. Finally, I had nearly forgotten this but the elevator doors close very quickly. We missed two because we were slow in getting there. Doesn't bother me, but I wonder if some seniors might find it difficult. Overall, nice rooms, fantastic location and nice, friendly staff."

1183,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Alexandria,2015-05-02T00:00:00Z,38.80474,-77.04455,5.0,Hotel is gorgeous! Rooms are beautifully decorated and very clean. Staff was very friendly and welcoming. Location was excellent. This is the only place I will stay when in Alexandria!
1184,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Alexandria,2016-04-26T00:00:00Z,38.80474,-77.04455,5.0,This was a delightful hotel stay - we got a real bargain - booked on the morning of our stay at a greatly reduced rate - what a deal!  Everything about this hotel was terrific particularly the location - lots of restaurants along with great walkable streets with historic homes and business.  We totally enjoyed this experience.
1185,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Alexandria,2015-06-30T00:00:00Z,38.80474,-77.04455,5.0,"Old Town Alexandria is beautiful with several restaurants within walking distance. Although I don't know much about this town, it seems as Hotel Monaco is located right in the middle of every everything. I'm returning to DC in August, and will definitely stay at this hotel (bringing my wife this time)!"
1186,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Alexandria,2014-02-19T00:00:00Z,38.80474,-77.04455,3.0,"My experience wasn't great. There was a ton of noise, not only in the room above mine, but in the hall as well. The walls must be paper thin. And the doors of the room have a tendency to be very heavy and slam behind you if you aren't aware... RECOMMENDATION TO HOTEL: Install device to the doors to soften the blow of doors slamming in the hall. I'm trying to sleep!!!"
1187,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Alexandria,2014-03-17T00:00:00Z,38.80474,-77.04455,5.0,"Everything was fantastic: location, door staff, etc. The only down note was at check-out there were some extra charges. We brought it to staff attention. She took some charges off, then we showed again where it was wrong. We were not upset at the charges as mistakes are made everywhere, but her attitude about it was very non-caring. I repeat, this waqs the ONLY down note and I STILL recommend the hotel. I believe the staff anme was Jackie."
1188,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Alexandria,2014-05-26T00:00:00Z,38.80474,-77.04455,5.0,"My stay was wonderful! I would recommend this hotel highly. From the valet parking attendant to the rest of the staff, everyone was wonderful. The rooms were immaculate and there are plenty of shops and restaurants within walking distance. The metro statio is about 10 blocks from the hotel but t he free trolley makes it a breeze to get thrs. I wish my stay was longer and I will definitely stay at the Monaco again!"
1189,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Alexandria,2015-05-03T00:00:00Z,38.80474,-77.04455,3.0,"The hotel is very convenient in its location to all the stuff in old town. The staff was courteous and professional. The decor is something of an aquired taste. The room was large and clean and a good price. However my ""courtyard view"" was little more than a view of the hotel's trash dumpster.  The situation with room service is sub par. It's a long story. Over all the hotel is a good place to stay given how centrally located it is in old town. Just don't expect too much from the room service."
1190,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Alexandria,2016-03-09T00:00:00Z,38.80474,-77.04455,4.0,I only spent on night here on business but would return for business or pleasure trips.

The location on King Street is in the middle of all the restaurants and walking distance to the water front. We stayed for New Year's Eve for Alexandria's First Night firework celebration and would do it again :). The staff is very friendly, the lobby is set up like you are in a comfy living room with of course, the traditional wine hour. The gym is fine but there is a great running / walking route along the water."
1196,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Alexandria,2016-08-15T00:00:00Z,38.80474,-77.04455,5.0,The team at the hotel took care of us like they had known us for years.  The customer service could not had been better.  A very pet friendly hotel.  Morning coffee and afternoon wine in the lobby was nice each day.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting the Alexandria area.

Otherwise I would recommend the hotel it was great, close to stores, restaurants and transportation. They are pet friendly and there was a good mix of people, I heard several languages spoken in the lobby."
1200,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Alexandria,2014-10-10T00:00:00Z,38.80474,-77.04455,5.0,Excellent staff; courteous and extremely helpful. Perfect location. Nice touch with happy hour and free coffee for the guests. The attached restaurant is very good. The room was very clean and the bed was comfortable and good pillows!
1201,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Alexandria,2014-09-17T00:00:00Z,38.80474,-77.04455,4.0,"The Hotels.com post - and my confirmation email - said ""free wifi"". This was the deciding factor over a nearby hotel that appeared cheaper but charged $15 a day for wifi. Turns out wifi is free ONLY FOR KIMPTON REWARDS MEMBERS. And they mean it, and they stood by it when I checked out. Only the Hotels.com confirmation email, with the words ""free wifi"" in it, and my threat to write to Hotels about it, changed their minds. Anyway, beware. All that said... I love this hotel. Amazing neighborhood, great hotel restaurant and bar, and it's pretty reasonable for what you get."
1202,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Alexandria,2016-10-24T00:00:00Z,38.80474,-77.04455,5.0,Nice and clean hotel.  Comfortable bed.

They allowed us to extend our reservation as necessary during the storm. A great hotel made better by caring service."

1209,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Alexandria,2016-05-02T00:00:00Z,38.80474,-77.04455,5.0,"Perfectly located in Old Town on King Street. The staff was friendly and helpful. The room was spacious, well-decorated and well-appointed (with a whimsical touch). The bathrobes were cheetah and zebra printed terry cloth, for example... It was great. Very convenient to Reagan National Airport and Washington, DC, too. We rode bikes to Mt. Vernon on the GW Parkway bike path which was walking distance from Hotel Monaco. All in all, pretty much perfect."

The other hotels are more toward upper end by Metro (a mile)this Hotel in perfect spot. If you want Metro there is a free shuttle every 15 minutes up and down King Street. Get you there no problem. What a neat place the whole area full of food, Irish Bars,great shopping. I would definitely come back to this Hotel. I had a suite and it had a balcony( not much view but ok if you smoke or just enjoy)"

This was it! From Hotel Monaco airport pick up on, we were treated very well. Love the lobby, great sofas, chairs, well placed tables with access to coffee and other drinks in the morning, candy stand and games in the afternoon, followed by wine and appetizers in the evening (for about 2 hours per event each day). In the room, we requested a rollaway bed. The bathroom was supplied with full size shampoo, conditioner and bathing gel. The closet was small, however, as we were only staying 2 nights, it was adequate for our needs. Questions asked were researched, if needed. Answers were complete."

The valet parking kept our truck safe and was very convenient...The only downside of the stay was minor-the handicapped bathroom was impossible to keep dry.  The water ran out of the shower enclosure and soaked the entire floor.  We will stay here again for sure!!!

It's expensive, but then again the whole town is so you should already be aware of that.Great if you have pets. My kids spent their time in the pool which has a lifeguard on duty a nice feature if you are looking after more then one kid."

Only down side is workout room is small and heat was set at 72 which was too warm. My room was near a storage room and people in there were very load at 5:30am and woke me up. There must have been shelves against the wall of my bed and they were so loud and aggressive that my bed was shaking."

Our room was a little dusty in a few spots but otherwise everything appeared clean. The people at the front desk were especially polite and courteous.

My Daughter was cheerleading at the game and my Fianc�� and her son had never been to DC before. This was my first time staying at the Monaco and I was very impressed from the moment I arrived and walked through the doors, the staff was very friendly and helpful, there is a trolley to and from the Metro station and the Blue line that runs directly to the Arlington Cemetery, Washington Mall, and all the way to FEDEX Field for the Game.... in our 5 day stay we enjoyed the nightly wine tasting and the assistance from the staff with a few business issues I had to deal with Olina at the front desk is Fantastic she is smart, efficient and handles business with a level of professionalism that you don't usually see in a young lady these days. All in all I will be a regular with Hotel Monaco from this point forward. Thank you all we will be back!"

I had a queen bed with a balcony...very nice. No coffee/tea in the room but there is a fridge with asst refreshments to purchase and coffee/tea down stairs in the AM. The hotel is centrally located in an adorably quaint town close to DC. There is a FREE trolly riding up and down King St every 15-20 min stopping on every 2 blocks for your convience. They are all brick sidewalks so wear walking shoes, not heels....I recommend and would go back"

1255,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Alexandria,2015-04-26T00:00:00Z,38.80474,-77.04455,5.0,This place was awesome!
1256,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Alexandria,2014-05-07T00:00:00Z,38.80474,-77.04455,4.0,"I really enjoyed the location, it was so close to the main street that runs through old town Alexandria. You could walk right out of the hotel and up and down King St to many stores, restaurants, bars, and the water. There was also a fresh farmers market in the town square literally steps from the hotel. I really enjoyed all the fresh produce and baked goods for sale there. The only thing I was unhappy with at the hotel was the parking garage. It is so small and it was packed when we checked in. Once we finally found a spot we chose to not even drive our vehicle as to not have to encounter that stressful dilemma again! Another issue was that the room did not have a microwave. If one stays several nights and has left overs from a restaurant you can not re-heat anything in your room. Plus the room comes with a refrigerator but they pack it with their items they want you to purchase so that was also a hassle I just took theirs own and put mine in until I was about to leave and then restocked it with their items. Other than that I thought the hotel was nice and very conveniently located."
1257,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Alexandria,2015-05-06T00:00:00Z,38.80474,-77.04455,5.0,Enjoyed the Monaco again. We have stayed there several times in the past. The staff is friendly and informative as well as helpful.We did request a Queen bed but since we arrived late in the evening only rooms with 2 Double Beds were available. Not a big deal but would have liked a room with a queen size bed.
1258,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Alexandria,2014-10-29T00:00:00Z,38.80474,-77.04455,5.0,Nice hotel within walking distance of the metro and lots of great tourists sites.  Beautiful neighborhood.  Friendly staff.  Would definitely stay there on my next trip to Alexandria.
1259,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Alexandria,2015-07-16T00:00:00Z,38.80474,-77.04455,4.0,The hotel was beautiful with great amenities. Several (not all) of the staff were not very friendly or accommodating. Snobbish and rude.
1260,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Alexandria,2014-10-21T00:00:00Z,38.80474,-77.04455,5.0,We were initially given an accessible room upon arrival. The room was fine except for the handicap shower which flooded the bathroom floor when my wife showered. I notified the front desk of the issue and they sent an employee to check the problem. The desk then called back and gave us another room without hesitation which we grateful for since their were a couple of weddings at the hotel that weekend. Overall very happy with the experience.
1261,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Alexandria,2016-07-06T00:00:00Z,38.80474,-77.04455,5.0,Fantastic Hotel with all anyone could ask for in Downtown Alexandria!!
1262,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Alexandria,2014-08-25T00:00:00Z,38.80474,-77.04455,5.0,O único porém do hotel é com relação ao aluguel de carro: muito caro para deixar estacionado o veículo no parking do hotel. De resto: gostei muito.

1265,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Alexandria,2016-03-23T00:00:00Z,38.80474,-77.04455,5.0,This hotel is great. It has a comfy room that is well decorated. The location in Old Town Alexandria is convenient to walk to shopping and food.

It is very elegant, the staff is extremely hospitable, and the location is top notch. My only complaint is that they charge $20/Day for parking, but that's easily fixed by parking around the corner (plenty of spots at night!)"

It had a minibar full of items (I love munching on snacks   prices were really good)Parking was the only thing ($27/night) which I guess is normal for that area.

Greeting as we pulled up was friendly as was the check in process. Room was small, bed uncomfortable and when I sat on the end it tipped forward. Bath sink was clogged. Staff in hotel dining room was excellent as was the food. Neighborhood great for walking, shopping and dining. Check out easy and friendly. Overnight parking charge seemed ridiculous especially when paying such a high price for a room."

Front desk staff made great recommendations for local restaurants. Hotel was clean, comfortable, and the bath robes were hillarious. I look forward to staying at Hotel Monaco again."
1278,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Alexandria,2016-08-19T00:00:00Z,38.80474,-77.04455,5.0,Hotel was fabulous.  The style and setting of the hotel is fitting for Old Town Alexandria.

Kids hour at 4pm, followed by wine hour at 5pm, allowed us all to feel as though we were welcomed guests. The pool was kept at a comfortable temperature and we spent many hours there during the week. Would stay here over and over again!"

The hotel did an excellent job with the ceremony, cocktail hour, and dinner. Thoroughly enjoyable. Our room was well appointed, but could have used an additional easy chair for both balance esthetically and for comfort. The desk chair and easy chair worked, but wasn't ideal for conversation. The restaurant was bustling in the morning and the wait staff hustled, but couldn't really keep up with the demand."
1284,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Alexandria,2014-09-25T00:00:00Z,38.80474,-77.04455,5.0,"This hotel was in the heart of Old Town, making it a great location for visiting Alexandria, with just a stroll down to the waterfront. The hotel decor gave it a stylish boutique feel and it was a great place to come back to after a day at a conference or shopping. A nice touch was the complimentary wine social hour in the lobby each evening. Guests participation was high, creating a lively social vibe. Eat at Restaurant Eve, right around the corner on Pitt Street for high-end craft cocktails, stellar service and ambiance, and some of the best dining in Old Town."

The only thing I didn't like was the coffee that was out out in the mornings, truly watered down- and I wouldn't be fm difficult if they didn't advertise it as artisan coffee. Spend less money on the cool design on the cups, and more on the quality of the coffee."
1289,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Alexandria,2014-08-13T00:00:00Z,38.80474,-77.04455,5.0,The trolley runs throughout the day and can take you to metro station. Jump on the metro and you're in D.C within 30 minutes! Loved the hotel!
1290,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Alexandria,2016-07-03T00:00:00Z,38.80474,-77.04455,5.0,"I love the Monaco, and the location.  I have been staying at that location since 1980 because I love Old Town.  Please keep up the good work so when I am back in VA it will always be as comfortable."
1291,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Alexandria,2015-04-16T00:00:00Z,38.80474,-77.04455,5.0,"The Monaco is located on Kings Street, the Main Street in Old Town Alexandria. Walk along King Street to wonderful shops and restaurants.  A short walk to the waterfront. If you drive into town the hotel has underground parking which wonderful because parking downtown can be difficult."

Complimentary Wine happy hour was nice, as was life guard at pool. Room was a little tight for 4 of us, but it was as big as most hotel rooms would be, nothing more. Shuttle to DCA airport was nice, trolley to Metro was convenient. Unfortunately, trolley doesn't start until 11:30 pm and there is no shuttle to the Metro so we walked a lot more than we expected we would. Overall, we would stay again."
1293,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Alexandria,2015-08-16T00:00:00Z,38.80474,-77.04455,5.0,I was very impressed with the little attention to details here. Wow. Awesome stay.

Could use another mirror of some sort in the general area of the bedroom there's a long mirror in the hall but it's not very useful. Decor is interesting but much too busy in the hallways in particular. Priced well, good area, and easy access. Would stay here again."
1297,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Alexandria,2016-02-10T00:00:00Z,38.80474,-77.04455,5.0,"Very upscale hotel right in the heart of everything.

When we went to have the wonderful breakfast room service brought us, after a comfortable sleep, one of the chairs was unusable without a creative mind and the table slanted so steep that our coffee spilt. Not a big deal really.Overall, after a few digs, I would return there again to say hi to the friendly staff. Great location to stay for a Nationals game."

Very kind and helpful, the place has the aura of home somehow--small but useful touches, such as cold lemonade, great coffee and tea, apples... makes it like home.  Clean rooms, and cleaning staff are careful not to get in your way. Location in Alexandria is excellent, with a pharmacy close by, and transport links too. I will be returning, and by then I hope the Metro is fixed so access to DC is better given the traffic jams of the city."
1308,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Alexandria,2015-05-13T00:00:00Z,38.80474,-77.04455,3.0,I was disappointed with my stay at this hotel. My room looked out on a party that was happening in a courtyard outside my window and was very noisy late into the night. The bed was too soft for my liking. Asked for memory foam pillow and it really wasn't memory foam. And to top it all off I left a pair of sandals in the room and there was NO chance they were left anywhere else and they were never turned into housekeeping. Staff was not receptive in finding my sandals. Disappointed
1309,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Alexandria,2015-10-04T00:00:00Z,38.80474,-77.04455,4.0,価格の割にはいろいろがっかりするホテルである。犬が自由に連れてこれるため常にロビーやエレベーターの中に犬がいる。＝匂いがある。　廊下も部屋もカーペットであるので匂いや汚れが気になる。スタッフはフレンドリーであるがそれ以上のものはない。場所はいいと思う。駅からは遠いが無料のトローリーバスがあるので便利。

Furnishings in the room and lobby were very nice. Staff were polite and helpful. Only complaint was the parking was a bit pricey. I would suggest parking in another ramp if you don't mind walking a few blocks.
1312,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Alexandria,2015-06-21T00:00:00Z,38.80474,-77.04455,5.0,Great location for Old Town.

The hotel is in the heart of the city but very quiet inside. Kimpton hotels are some of my favorites; I stay in them in many different cities around the country. Each one is uniquely decorated and has its own character, so it definitely does not feel like a chain. And yet they all conform to high standards of service, hospitality, and quality"

1316,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Alexandria,2014-03-09T00:00:00Z,38.80474,-77.04455,3.0,Our room wasn't very clean with blood or puke dripping down the toilet. We had to get our keys reprogrammed each day. The room doors slam shut and there isn't much noise proofing so that woke us up. The free wi-fi is only free after you sign up for a loyalty program. It is nicely decorated though.
1317,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Alexandria,2015-06-29T00:00:00Z,38.80474,-77.04455,3.0,Everything about this hotel is pretty positive except---the A/C in the room was terribly loud! Could not switch because they were booked!

Choice and quality are sub optimal. Not value for money, and not what you would expect. Breakfast has been bad experience."

1320,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Alexandria,2014-11-25T00:00:00Z,38.80474,-77.04455,4.0,"The hotel is centrally located, and the room was spacious and beautifully furnished. The other facilities are tastefully decorated, but small, given the grandeur the hotel is trying to portray. There are amenities, but with nearly everything with this hotel, it comes at an additional cost (parking, wifi, etc). The staff is friendly, but lacking a professional demeanor, and information regarding services and benefits provided will only come if you know to ask (wine and breakfast). We looked forward for some time to staying here, and now that we have, it is unlikely that we'll repeat."

When i come to Alexandria I always like to stay at the Monaco b/c of the fitness center.  Its small, but has what i need.  But this time, there were weights missing.  There was no jump rope.  And the water cooler was empty.  Not good.  I may consider another hotel next time."

I believe it now. My room was tucked away in the farthest corner with a view of the dirty rooftop. There was a humming sound coming from outside that I didn't know would become irritating while sleeping. One set of friends had to move rooms because they didn't have hot water. The next morning they ordered breakfast through room service and gave up after 1 1/2 hours of no breakfast. I found out during the night that my room had no heat. When I first checked in, I just dropped my bags in the room and left to meet my group, so didn't notice that there was a problem. I returned late in the evening and it was cool in the room so adjusted the thermostat thinking it would heat up while I was sleeping. No such luck, at 3 am I woke up and it was 63 degrees in my room. Since I didn't want to deal with an engineer at that time of night, I bundled up, cranked the thermostat to 84 went back to bed. At 6:30, I gave up, showered and went down to the lobby where it was warm to await by friends. When I checked out, I told the clerk that they should check the heat since I had the thermostat cranked to 84 and it was still only 63 degrees. I was given a $7.50 breakfast for my trouble.Thank god I had a discounted rate, this hotel is expensive for what it is and what it offers. And why no coffee in the rooms?"

THE STAFF WERE HELPFUL.  THE STANDARD KING ROOM WAS SPACIOUS.  WE HAD A STREET VIEW OF KING STREET, WHICH WAS GREAT.  THE RESTAURANT AND BAR HAD EXCELLENT SERVICE.  WE TRAVELED INTO DC 3 DAYS AND HAD 2 DAYS OF DAY TRIPS.  WE WERE VERY CLOSE TO MT VERNON AND TRAVELED TO ANAPOLIS AND BALTIMORE THE OTHER DAY.  WE USED THE METRO TO GET IN AND AROUND DC.  THE HOTEL WAS WELCOMING TO KIDS AND PETS, WHICH WAS A PLUS FOR MANY PEOPLE.  OVERALL, I WOULD STAY HERE AGAIN."

I have stayed there many times, and without problem, however this trip I had extremely limited hot water at both the sink and the shower. This was the case both at check in and the next morning.

Very good restaurants, especially Le Madeleine, close by and the waterfront is within easy walking distance. Trolley run to the King St. Metro which connects to the DC and surrounding area. There is a courtesy van that will pickup and take you to the Reagan Airport (DCA) which was not advertised. Use it. We will stay there again."

It's a fun yet chic atmosphere; they serve wine from 5 to 6 every evening in the lobby.  The metro is about a mile on King Street, an easy walk, and then visited the sites of Washington from there.  The only annoyance was that the room key card lost its charge several times, so that needed recharging or a new key card.  The staff was cheerful dealing with that issue, however.  Highly recommend, especially if you get a good price, like I did, on Expedia.  $110 a night."

Easy to get to the Metro train station to go anywhere else.Was disappointed as I don't think The Monaco was up to the same standard as other Kimpton properties. The walls are very thin and you can easily hear conversations in the next room. Housekeeping failed to refresh toiletries, requiring a call at 4 am to get shampoo. Won't be returning to this one unfortunately."

The Hotel Monaco and the Old Towne area was the best choice to make my return home more than memorable.

We changed from another Kimpton property because of the shuttle.  We could've taken the metro if we stayed at the other Kimpton.  I just felt like it was a bit of false advertising by Expedia at the Hotel Monaco.  This was a $20 error, and the hotel couldn't do anything to make it right.  Is there anything Expedia is willing to do to earn our business in the future?  We will be travelling a lot to the East Coast now that our son is in school there.  Please let us know."

1366,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Alexandria,2015-10-05T00:00:00Z,38.80474,-77.04455,4.0,I booked three rooms for 7 cousins for our annual get-together.  We almost cancelled because of an impending hurricane but were so glad we braved the rain.  When we arrived we were given rooms on the 6th floor where there was a leak.  We requested and soon got rooms on the second floor.  We had a lovely time and really enjoyed the wine reception each day.  We used the restaurant for a lavish breakfasts and brunch.  The staff was super efficient and friendly and booked us restaurant reservations that I could not get on my own.  I have stayed at the Monaco several times before and because I always had a great time I recommended that we have our annual visit there.  No one was disappointed!

Staff is welcoming and knowledgable and check-in was a breeze. The 5-6 pm happy hour in the lobby is clearly a big draw as it was packed with enthusiastic wine drinkers, several with their dogs who are welcomed at the hotel.Valet parking is available or you can self park in the underground garage which we did. However the validated ticket didn't work and we had to pay to get out. There is a $29 per day parking charge but the staff were quick to override the charge given our difficulty.Highly recommend this hotel."

We flew in and didn't rent a car so we walked everywhere we wanted to go and it was great. It's close to the Harbour, shopping and lots of restaurants and historic attractions. If you aren't into walking the free shuttle runs on King Street and is very easy to access. They have free pick up at the airport and also for your return. No in room coffee which I missed but coffee and teas available in the lobby every morning which was nice and a wine reception in the afternoon. If we ever go back to Alexandria we wouldn't stay anywhere else."
1371,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Alexandria,2016-05-12T00:00:00Z,38.80474,-77.04455,4.0,Had two days of meetings in the immediate are and this hotel was located within walking distance to the meetings. Room was nice but hallway smelled like a wet dog...lots of rain in the region so could be understandable until I saw someone with a dog sitting in the lobby. I am not a pet owner but do understand that those who are sometimes forget about all the paying (nearly $300 a night) customers with pet allergies who have to stay in a hotel that apparently allows pets. Just need to keep a lower profile and keep them out of the public areas.
1372,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Alexandria,2014-02-16T00:00:00Z,38.80474,-77.04455,2.0,"I booked a room with the understanding that the bathroom would have the tub that was pictured online. This was NOT the case at all. Tried to go swimming but everytime i went to check out the pool it was closed. The heater in the room was so loud turning on and off it woke me up throughout the night. I feel as if i was way over charged for what i got. I went there for a romantic get away and ended up walking away feeling like i could have gone somewhere else and got a better deal, with better service, and had the services i paid for but never recieved (such as the pool and the big bathroom i saw online)available to me."

Alexandria is a lovely place and the Monaco is in a great location in the Old Town, and close to the free trolley to King Street metro station, so you can also get into DC easily. The staff were friendly and helpful, and the room was stylish and comfortable. No tea/coffee maker, but they will provide one on request. I will definitely stay there again the next time I visit Alexandria."

It appeared to be a combination of unfamiliarity, apathy and unwillingness to take action. This tainted this hotel experience very unpleasant. This is not Hotels.com fault but with the Monaco Hotel reception staff.I had to contact Hotels.com inorder to persuade Hotel Monaco staff to provide me a room which I had already paid. it was late at night, it took far too long and was very frustrating."

We've stayed at other Kimpton Hotels and this one measured up with excellence all around.  Friendly staff, clean, and tastefully decorated.  Coffee and Hot Chocolate on the weekend were a hit.  La Madeleine next door to the hotel was a great breakfast spot.  We also enjoyed Chadwick's for dinner- a short walk down to the water."

After their fifth visit, and many explanations about how the front desk authorized my late check-out, I left at 11:15 am (45 minutes before actual check-out time). I was unable to complete my work for my meetings, and left shaken and annoyed. The desk clerk seemed uninterested in my situation. What started out as a pleasurable experience, ended very differently."

1380,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Alexandria,2015-10-15T00:00:00Z,38.80474,-77.04455,3.0,"Overall this is a great hotel, in a terrific location. Very easy to find. The room was spacious and well appointed. The wireless access was easy and very fast. My only complaints were the in-room iron was in very poor shape and the bathtub / shower tap had a continuous trickle of water unless you turned the knob slightly over toward the ""on"" position, which is obviously counter-intuitive. In the spirit of full disclosure, I did not bring this up with anyone until I was checking out. I was only staying for 2 nights and only needed the iron 1 of the mornings. My other negative was - while I was toweling off after my morning shower, I noticed a long strand of dark hair hanging off my shoulder. This was a bit gross as it clearly wasn't mine - I am pretty much bald with only a bit of ""peach-fuzz"" on the sides, which is mostly grey. It clearly must have come off the towel, which makes you wonder a bit about their laundry regime. Although, it could also have come off the cleaning staff when they were replacing the towels in the room. Either way a little ""icky"" from my perspective. However, when I brought the iron and bath tap issue up with the front desk attendant at check-out he was very apologetic and ""comped"" me a night of valet parking."

The eclectic and stylish Kimpton decor is a treat, both in the room and in public areas. Immaculately clean. Attentive staff.Location is unexpectedly fantastic. King street Alexandria can be toured on foot end to end, full of boutiques and restaurants. Alexandria has historic homes and the riverfront parks, plus the running/cycle path from DC to Mount Vernon runs right through it.Also worth noting is you are in DC in 15 mins by car, or you can take the free shuttle down king street to the metro.The only minor complain is a noisy AC in the room, and thats nitpicking really."

The decor is very warm and eclectic. Not at all like the typical sterile hotel lobby. The fire was burning in the fireplace and the furniture is bright and modern and warm all at the same time. The valet service was perfect; they remembered us and my car was outside without a wait, even though the hotel was totally booked. I mentioned that we were celebrating my mother's birthday when we checked in. When we returned from an outing there was a bottle of wine and a chocolate dessert waiting for us. It was the most personal experience I have had in a long time and I travel extensively. The location is perfect for eating, shopping and access to the metro, if you are interested in touring DC."

Many other guests complained, and lasted into the evening.  Housekeeping was a joke.  They didn't vacuum or pick up trash or towels in the room; bathroom cleaning was minimal.  They also knocked on the door and opened it even though the ""do not disturb"" notice was hanging on the door."

Front desk gal couldn't find my reservation, but luckily the manager or whoever was close by and he was able to find it. Bathroom faucet handle loose and wobbling all over. I should have read more about room. No in-room coffee pot and shuttle to airport didn't start until 7 a.m., causing me to have to take an additional cab. Not some place I would stay again, but ok.

The King St. trolly goes right by the hotel every 15 min. and is free to ride, will take to to the water front or the Metro with several stops on the way. There were a lot of dogs in the motel but if I had not seen the dogs I would not have known they were there. Very quite and did not have a ""dog"" smell. The restaurant next to the hotel was a bit pricey but the waiter and waitress were very helpful with area information"

The hallway on the 6th floor had a very musty bad odor, not a good first impression.  The room had an equally musty odor... ick!  I turned the A/C off when I left and came back to a freezing room.

The room was very nice and clean, but there was big scratches on the headboard. The showerhead is dated and not great shower pressure. When I pulled the lever on the spout to transfer the water to the shower head, I could pull the entire spout from the wall; and the toilet ran every 30 minutes and woke me up many times at night. I informed the hotel during my check-out, so it could be rectified for the next guest. I stayed one night, last year at this time, and remember having similar ""small"" issues with my room. I think for $325 for one night, I will try another hotel next year."
1414,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Alexandria,2014-05-16T00:00:00Z,38.80474,-77.04455,1.0,"My wife and I stayed at Hotel Monaco to celebrate out wedding anniversary and it was one of the worst hotel experience we have had. Do not let the decor fool you. Our first room on the 4th floor was like having your bedroom set in a dog kennel, with dog owners leaving their pets unattended in their room while they were dinning and going out. Those poor dogs were barking to death and we asked to be moved. With our luck we were put next door to a room with about 10 people drinking and partying loudly until quite late which prompted us to move again. They put us on the 6th floor in a beat up room with its wallpaper coming off. It was not fully furnished compared to the other 2 rooms we saw previously. It had an ikea plastic chair and only one window the size of a basement window with a broken rolling shade (I wish I could attach the pictures I took). To top it off our room was right across the 3 elevators and their lovely bells that rang all night long. We could not sleep without earplugs. No boutique hotel would have rooms facing the elevators. There usually is a hallway design such as no bedroom door would be 10 feet away from the elevators. This is not a boutique hotel, not even close. More like a bad Holiday Inn."

1417,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Alexandria,2014-04-27T00:00:00Z,38.80474,-77.04455,3.0,We spent four nights in this hotel whilst touring Virginia. First impression was that we didn`t like the dark entrance and wondered what it was hiding! Check in was straightforward and we had a comfortable room. Our booking said we had free Wi-Fi but this turned out not to be the case. We soon realised what was being hidden - paw prints and dog hairs. I have never seen so many dogs in a hotel in my life (some really big ones too). We like dogs and are not afraid of them but didn`t like the idea of sharing a luxury? hotel room with one. It rained heavily when we were there and I am afraid there is no getting away from the smell of wet dog! This is the reason I would not recommend this hotel to some of my friends as they are not dog lovers and would simply have left. Everything else about the hotel was fine although it was not as nice as the Kimpton we stayed in in Philadelphia.
1418,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Alexandria,2015-01-06T00:00:00Z,38.80474,-77.04455,5.0,"We loved the coziness of this hotel and the location. It has a CVS Pharmacy across the street and a Starbucks 2 blocks up. Some of our favorite resturants close by were Gadsby's Tavern and the Columbus Firehouse and for seafood, The Fish Market.  The Fish Market has no atmosphere, but the biggest oysters in town. The hotel has a free shuttle to and from the airport and free wine from 5-6.  The staff was helpful and friendly. We would definitely stay again."
1419,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Alexandria,2015-02-19T00:00:00Z,38.80474,-77.04455,2.0,Valet service was unorganized upon our arrival - I had to go find them and then my husband had to drive around the block until they could accommodate us- our room was not ready (even at 5pm when we arrived) - they took our phone number to call us when it was ready and then never called - we called back at 7:30pm. - On one of our days our room was never serviced - took 45 minutes to have someone come and give us clean towels - staff was curt when I called them-- had to extend our stay one night due to weather - was told it was all set when I called from DC but when we got back to the hotel the desk was unaware that we were staying another night - lots of confusion about us having to move to another room or not move as they were doing renovations on our floor. Just very unorganized.

Walk a few blocks in either direction and there are plenty of restaurants and bars.  It was a short drive into DC. Less than 10 minutes to the national harbor and about 20 min with traffic to the national mall. There is also a metro stop nearby the hotel.  The room was spacious and had a nice sized bathroom.  The parking at the hotel was $29, but there is a garage right next door that charges $5 for the day. I would definitely stay again when visiting DC."

Old Alexandria itself offers history, shopping and fine restaurants on the doorstep. The hotels own restaurant, Jackson 20, offers a good choice for breakfast and dinner.

Weekend nightlife made for a lot of noise, but very quiet during the week. Really enjoyed the hotel. Had lifeguard (?!?) on duty.

The energy and vibe when you walk in hotel is like no other hotel I���ve ever stayed in except another Kimpton. Since we were staying over a weekend, the hotel was packed with wedding parties which made the happy hour time very lively.The room was fabulous and not cookie cutter. The robes were almost worth the price of admission! Love the d��cor and the staff was very friendly. Really enjoyed talking with folks during the happy hour. The only complaint is they really need more space ��� it���s that popular.It���s a pet friendly hotel and we did not travel with a pet.

Doggie happy hour was great. The maid did not speak English so it was hard to communicate with her, yet she did an outstanding job. The men who opened doors and did the valet parking were obnoxious. They wanted a tip for just opening the door. If I tipped them for every time they got my car and opened a door I would have spent an extra $100. I bought some wine and one of the men kept bugging me to give him a bottle of wine. These men would stand around and talk in their native tongue which I think is rude. I speak their language and they were saying rude things about me and other guests. Unacceptable. That said, I would stay here again."

Right on King Street in Old Town Alexandria, and down close to the harbor. Very easy to walk for anything you need. Out for a snack or a meal, coffee or bagels, a walk down to the waterfront, a drugstore. And with the King Street Trolley you can easily get to the Metro. The room was spacious and very clean and comfortable and while youwere aware that is is an old building it was hid very well.The lobby and was open and welcoming but in the end the presentation and feel of the ""boutique hotel"" was not for us. There seemed to be a little something that rubbed me the wrong way about things. From the check in where we were told and extra $50 a night would be charged to our credit card for incidentals and would be refunded if we didn't use it. To the ""doormen"" that held open the door and kept talking to each other as you walked thru. Then there was the shuttle to the airport that didn't start to 7AM so was no use to us. The free wi-fi that you had to sign up as a loyalty member to use (on the longest form I have ever seen) To the dogs barking in the lobby. I like dogs but while a crying baby in a motel is horror story often told we all know the parents are doing what they can but a dog left barking in a room is just rude not cute at all."

1450,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Alexandria,2015-04-17T00:00:00Z,38.80474,-77.04455,3.0,"Okay, you can access Wi-fi, but only after becoming a Kimpton member, which involves writing a book and giving up substantial amounts of data about yourself. Data that is apparently worth about $12.99 to Kimpton, since that's what they charge for 24 hours of access. I found it insulting after paying this kind of money for a room, when almost any of the 'lesser' chains would provide it for free. Fortunately there are cafes nearby if you don't have a data plan and need to check a flight. Valet parking was a disaster- very disorganized and we had to go find our own car after waiting on the sidewalk for a long while."

Room was comfortable and roomy but the bathroom was too small. Trying to get ready in the morning required taking turns. No other mirror with an outlet anywhere else in the room.

VERY difficult to pull up to front of hotel; only a few spots and double parking is necessary. The garage was difficult to navigate my SUV in to so I ended paying for valet not to deal with it. I ordered hot water for tea one night and after 1.5 hours it never came and I canceled the order. The restaurant staff was very nice however my shrimp and grits was GREASY and my collard greens were gritty. My breakfast room service was fine. GREAT location for stores, restaurants, walking around."

First of all, the hotel staff did not give out accurate information regarding parking and what fees would be charged. They told my husband one price and told me another. On top of that, they charged us for parking on an individual daily basis and a nightly basis so we got charged double. When I spoke with the front desk they said that it was 'just the way it works'. Absolutely horrible. The front desk assigned another couple to the room we were staying in so me and my husband were in bed when additional guests barged in our room, using keys that they got from the front desk! The room looks nothing like it does in the pictures. I understand marketing strategies but it was a far stretch from what they'd have you believe online. Do not stay here! The hotel staff are awful and inconsistent, the room is not the same as advertised, and you'll be charged an arm and a leg in additional fees."

Business or pleasure if you are going to D.C. and don't want to deal with D.C., Alexandria is the place and this Hotel is in the middle of everything. The have valet parking for $27 a day but right next to Madeline's(across the street) is a garage that cost $10 a day. Everything was clean, staff was helpful.

Old Alexandria is such fun and the very best place to stay smack in the middle of King St is the Monaco.  Great big warm fire in lobby.  Free wine party every day at 5.  Terrific staff and lovely rooms.    One of the areas best indoor heated pools makes this hotel one you hate to leave even for all the fun right outside its doors.

A little ways from the metro station, but there is a trolley that runs from 10-10 every 15 mins.  It was a lifesaver in the rain!  The staff was wonderful.  The kids loved the pool.  Lots of great restaurants and shopping nearby. Happy hour every evening.  Lots of dogs and very dog-friendly!"

Good value for the room price and location, but we felt nickel-and-dimed by all the add-ons. They charged nearly $30/night for parking, $15/night for a refrigerator in the room (we're traveling with an infant so needed something for milk storage), and another charge (I can't remember how much) for wi-fi access. A truly high-class hotel would never charge extra for a refrigerator in the room or wi-if access. That said, it was still a nice price for the quality of the rooms, the staff was friendly, and we enjoyed our stay very much."

It's right in the heart of Old Town Alexandria, and close to everything you could possibly want. We walked down to the river, then back up on the next street over to have dinner at Gadsby's Tavern, which was amazing. The hotel staff are very polite, all have beautiful smiles on their faces, the rooms are lovely and extremely comfortable - overall just a great experience. I would recommend this hotel to anyone."

My reservation was lost and I was put in a cramped, musty smelling room. The hallways were dark and creepy. On top of everything they put a $651 hold on my card even though I had already paid in full when I booked my room. What did they expect me to order six hundred dollars in room service? Management was very unhelpful. I was given an email address for the manager instead of a phone number and still have not heard back. Save yourself the stress and disappointment and go somewhere else."

I arrive into DC on a late flight, got to the hotel at around 1:00am and was informed that there were no more rooms. They put me in a cab to go to another hotel. Not exactly what you are looking forward to at that time in the morning."

Rooms (at least the one we had) clean, comfortable but not expansive. The free wine happy hour is best skipped for a beer or wine in the neighborhood. Skip the Mexican food on King Street as well."
1490,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Alexandria,2015-02-11T00:00:00Z,38.80474,-77.04455,4.0,Hotel Monaco is an adorable hotel. We loved everything about it from the decor to the cocktail hour in the afternoon. The only reason we did not rate this property 5 stars is because there was construction going on and we needed to move rooms 3 times. Maybe next time we will bring our dog since it is dog friendly!
1491,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Alexandria,2014-07-11T00:00:00Z,38.80474,-77.04455,4.0,"Pet friendly is one thing. But there were entirely too many large dogs - in the lobby, at the happy hour and in the elevators. If you have allergies, like we do, this is a major problem that we were not prepared for. Our room was pet free, but dogs were on the furniture in the lobby and shaking their dander in all the public spaces. The elevators had slobber smell. There has to be a better way to accommodate pet lovers and those who are not. Disappointed for sure - we were there for a wedding."

Perhaps it's an east-coast thing, but I have a problem with guests who think everyone will be as in love with their dog as they are! And I am a dog person.Kimpton explains that Mr. Kimpton loved dogs so they're ""dog friendly"". But, dogs on the leashes at the wine social in the lobby and the yapping in the hall was overly accomodative"

They got my reservation wrong, though. I booked a queen single bed and they put me in a room with two double beds. I am a big guy so that makes a difference to me. When I requested that they fix the error, the refused saying that they couldn't because a large group was coming in and had the rooms together. I felt like I was not important to the hotel. I would have went to a different hotel, but it was late and I was very tired. Other than my feet hanging off the bed, the room was nice. I might go back."

Staff super friendly and courteous.  Super room.  Fantastic room and decore was to die for.  All in all I haven't been so relaxed from a vacation.  I hated to come home!
1518,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Alexandria,2015-07-04T00:00:00Z,38.80474,-77.04455,4.0,"We stayed at this hotel with our two cats. The hotel was very accommodating and we had no problem settling in our room. We noticed several  guests with dogs. The only down side was that even though when we first arrived there were no pet smells, by the time we left a few days later, the hallways had a definite dog sent. Not pleasant!"
1519,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Alexandria,2014-04-01T00:00:00Z,38.80474,-77.04455,5.0,The hotel Monaco is typical of what I've found at every kimpton hotel... Excellent service and willingness to go the extra mile. On this recent trip we spent our five year anniversary with Monaco and they provided champaign and a room upgrade. Just a small example but pretty standard for them. Very clean and a great location.
1520,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Alexandria,2016-04-18T00:00:00Z,38.80474,-77.04455,5.0,"The hotel was very well situated and easy to get to with free parking, free wifi, happy hour and coffee provided at no extra cost. We were also allowed to leave our car parked in their garage after we had checked out"
1521,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Alexandria,2015-08-03T00:00:00Z,38.80474,-77.04455,5.0,Great place to stay if you want a top rated hotel and are not constrained with price. It is right in the middle of Olde Town Alexandria
1522,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Alexandria,2016-06-06T00:00:00Z,38.80474,-77.04455,5.0,Lovely couple time.
1523,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Alexandria,2014-01-06T00:00:00Z,38.80474,-77.04455,5.0,"Everything was great, from front desk to valet to quality and cleanliness of the room. Quiet yet right in the middle of everything and just blocks from the water. The adjoining restaurant was really good, too. We only had appetizers and a few cocktails but both were solid. Tuna carpaccio was especially good and the oysters were fresh with a great vinegar sauce. A nice night away!"
1524,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Alexandria,2016-04-03T00:00:00Z,38.80474,-77.04455,5.0,The staff were great. The took the time to get to know my name and said good morning/evening etc everytime they saw me. Loved the personalization.

1526,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Alexandria,2014-04-21T00:00:00Z,38.80474,-77.04455,5.0,Check in was easy. The hotel was very child friendly. The pool hours were extended for the Spring Break so the kids could enjoy the pool later and they played a movie in the pool area. We had a great trip and would come again.
1527,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Alexandria,2016-10-18T00:00:00Z,38.80474,-77.04455,5.0,Great experience. Will stay again
1528,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Alexandria,2015-11-24T00:00:00Z,38.80474,-77.04455,5.0,"First time stop over in Alexandria on my way back from picking up my daughter from Elon University heading back to Long Island. It's about half way between. Old Town was great, hotel's location was awesome, had the best corn beef and cabbage ever at Daniel O'Connels, although Jackson 20 @ the hotel looked great too - probably the busiest restaurant on all of King St and we were hungry and didn't want to wait. Hotel lobby, hallways, rooms all we impeccable and gave off such a great vibe. You felt privileged to be a guest there. Fabulous place to stay with a dog too. I guess it's pretty obvious that I enjoyed my quick stay here!"
1529,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Alexandria,2016-01-06T00:00:00Z,38.80474,-77.04455,5.0,"This was our first time in a Kimpton Hotel - Hotel Monaco is a great hotel within a short walk on King St. to the New Year's Eve fireworks extravaganza on the Potomac in Alexandria, VA. It is a pet friendly hotel - we did not have a pet - so were roomed on a non-pet floor.  However, we could have had a ""goldfish"" if we'd wanted a pet!!!!  They also had a reception in the lobby from 5-6 pm where wines - red, white sparkling were served - don't know if this is a daily event or just because this was New Year's Eve. It was well attended - nice friendly people."
1530,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Alexandria,2014-06-24T00:00:00Z,38.80474,-77.04455,5.0,We visited twice in 12 day holiday. My wife fell in love with it and took lots of interior photos. The first visit was after a flight delay and then problems with the GPS/Satnav which meant a five hour total delay. We were given TLC at check in and drinks vouchers for their bar restaurant. The food was good and a really nice Friday night atmosphere in the restaurant. We rushed off early the next morning. The second visit for two nights was also good. We had a room with a balcony which was unusual for the USA and we enjoyed this opportunity to read and relax on the balcony. Another good meal in the restaurant on the second night.
1531,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Alexandria,2016-06-23T00:00:00Z,38.80474,-77.04455,5.0,Was there on Business.  The only issue we had is that it is $29 per day to park!
1532,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Alexandria,2016-07-15T00:00:00Z,38.80474,-77.04455,5.0,2nd stay in a month and it was an easy choice for visits to the greater DC area.  Love it.

1534,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Alexandria,2015-07-18T00:00:00Z,38.80474,-77.04455,4.0,"We chose this hotel due to location, and because we had been here previously for one night; we stayed several days this time. Location can't be beat. Room amenities are excellent. Bed was a little hard. Staffers are very nice, but they seem to need more. Front doormen seemed more interested in chatting with each other than serving guests but once you got their attention, they could be helpful. If you stay here, you MUST love dogs. The hotel is overrun with guests' dogs who are all generally well-behaved, but they are everywhere. We knew the hotel was dog-friendly but it was rather overwhelming. We will stay here again, but at a time when there are fewer families likely to be traveling (hence, fewer dogs)."
1535,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Alexandria,2014-07-30T00:00:00Z,38.80474,-77.04455,5.0,This is an awesome hotel.  Very convenient to public transportation and the waterfront.  The hotel is beautiful and the staff was amazing.

Staff was very helpful as well. Walls are thin so it can be very noisy if people are talking in the hall or their rooms. That said, I would stay there again if I was in Alexandria."
1538,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Alexandria,2014-11-30T00:00:00Z,38.80474,-77.04455,5.0,A great place to stay within walking distance of excellent restaurants and fabulous shopping.  The staff is courteous and efficient.

The staff are so friendly and the location is perfect for exploring Old Town. I have stayed with my 2 daughters from when they were ages 5 to 11 and they love it as well! It's perfect and fun on the holidays.
1546,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Alexandria,2016-10-11T00:00:00Z,38.80474,-77.04455,3.0,Room was not ready at 3:00 but they did get a room for us. Told it was no pet floor but there was a dog next door. Guy was smoking on balcony in next room. Otherwise it was a friendly staff and an enjoyable stay.
1547,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Alexandria,2016-08-15T00:00:00Z,38.80474,-77.04455,4.0,"Friendly hotel in a lovely neighborhood. Some of the ""deluxe"" rooms are small and anything but deluxe. Our first room looked out on a solid brick wall that covered all the windows, making it very dark as well as small."
1548,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Alexandria,2015-05-21T00:00:00Z,38.80474,-77.04455,5.0,"Interesting location...in the heart of Old Town Alexandria.  Surrounded by shops and restauants.   Wine tasting in the lobby of Hotel.  Restaurant connected to hotel.  Even though dogs are allowed in the hotel, I did not see any inside, nor did I hear any dogs barking.  Excellent Robes.  No refrigerator in room...no coffee machine."
1549,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Alexandria,2015-08-11T00:00:00Z,38.80474,-77.04455,5.0,"Great romantic getaway to the Monaco-second time staying here. Well-appointed, helpful staff, and pet friendly! There was some water damage to a wall in our room which was surprising."
1550,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Alexandria,2016-03-28T00:00:00Z,38.80474,-77.04455,5.0,It was awesome that the Hotel offered complimentary bicycles. We had a most enjoyable bike ride to Mt. Vernon.

The staff was excellent: as I am partially disabled, I require certain types of rooms and the hotel accommodated promptly. The room was comfortable and the location of the hotel -- near the center of charming Old Town Alexandria -- could not be better. However, my family and I were disturbed by a race-baiting plaque on the hotel exterior, which we thought very inappropriate for a hotel of the quality of the Monaco. When brought to the attention of the hotel staff, they seemed not to know the history of the plaque."
1552,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Alexandria,2014-11-30T00:00:00Z,38.80474,-77.04455,5.0,"Purpose of the visit was a conference in National Harbor.  Greeted by a lovely staff who held our bags and got us in to the room in an hour ( way before checkin time!) by calling us at a nearby restaurant.  Plus, we were not part of another large wedding group.  Loved the room: comfortable bed, shower was great, super clean overall!  Location is excellent!  Near shops and lots of restaurants, Starbucks and CVS right out the door.  Not close to metro, so we took cabs to all the sights.  Wine for free everyday for one hour where we met many nice people.  Well behaved dogs are welcome.   Second time with Kimpton, and I decided to join their rewards program.  Outstanding in every way!"

Blocks away from the Potomac. Free trolley brings you to the metro station. Can't ask for a better location.
1556,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Alexandria,2014-09-26T00:00:00Z,38.80474,-77.04455,1.0,We stayed for 2 nights and loved our room and location of the hotel. Room had a colonial feel and was roomy. Hotel is right on King st in old town Alexandria. Surrounded by cute shops and easy access to the trolly which goes to the metro. Can't wait to stay again!

Had a great time! Hotel Monaco was awesome! We enjoyed the decor, and Christmas decorations. The Jackson 20 restaurant was also excellent. We had the best duck dish anywhere (better than Chinatown 0 San Francisco!). Except for a little confusion with our room service breakfast order, everything else went great. The staff are particularly welcoming and friendly, from the front desk, to the valet, bellman, and the waiter. Just terrific! We live about 2 hours away, so we'll be back for more visits for sure!"

Overnight parking across the street in public parking was $15 compared to the hotel's valet of $27 or $29, so I recommend parking in the Courthouse garage.  Staff was very friendly and helpful.  Great brunch onsite."

The room though small was ample. Front desk and all employees very friendly and helpful. The wine tasting happy hour was great! Location was perfect. We took other reviewers advice and used the parking garage across the street which was half the cost. And the lobby morning coffee was very good too!

The service was not up to what is expected for a Monaco hotel. When we arrived, it was raining and we had to wait out by our car for the valet and bellboy to come out. They weren't busy at all; they were just standing around. On several occasions, there was no one available to open the doors or they were just standing around talking. The first night, we had problems with kids in the swimming pool after midnight making noise and running around. We tried to call downstairs but the room phone didn't work so we had to use our cell phone. After the call was made, the noise stopped after a while. The next morning, the toilet wouldn't flush. We advised the front desk and they fixed the toilet and looked at the room phone. When we mentioned all of this to the person checking us out, they comped us for one night of parking. Honestly, we were expecting more than that, but it was a nice gesture. The room was nice but not very big."
1575,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Alexandria,2015-03-02T00:00:00Z,38.80474,-77.04455,5.0,It was a typical Kimpton hotel - classy and chic

We found the service and management pretty bad.  The manager lied to us saying first they didn't even offer ""queen sized beds"" when we ended up with two doubles instead of the queen and then blamed it was our fault because we booked on Expedia.  We looked on their website and saw they did offer queen beds and have availability at the time and we then ended getting a room with a queen since ""they just has a cancellation"".  Then we ordered room service, waiting an hour, called back and our order was never even put in.  The girl we had ordered with ""left a long time ago"".  We did get a $25 credit to dine at Jackson 20, though.  Their food is good and it is a fun atmosphere.  Honestly, the Kimpton hotels are nice except for the service.  I believe they just have weak management.  We had a brunch for a baptism the same weekend at their other hotel (Morrison) and they were clearly understaffed and disorganized.  It was terribly slow and the manager of the food place only had one person taking care of 16 of us (this was a prearranged private booked brunch).  The food was good but it took 20 mins to get everyone their entree when it was a preset menu of choosing from two items  Definitely not the fault of the poor guy waiting on us but some problem with the kitchen or management."

Friendly staff greeted me at the door, as well as at the front desk, where I was treated to drinks in the bar.  The d��cor is a bit busy, but fun.  My room was on a nice courtyard, which was closed for the winter.  I loved the d��cor, finish, appointment and comfort of the room.  Bed was super nice, bathroom, spacious and marble throughout.  Went to the bar for a night cap the first night, and a lively bar scene of patrons in their 30's to 60's, bartender made my custom drink, and I, being alone, enjoyed soaking in the atmosphere, trying to stay off my phone, except to check the hockey scores.  Parking garage in the basement was key and convenient.  There was a pool, but I was a bit disappointed there was not a hot tub.  Other than that minor disappointment, the staff was super helpful and polite."

Two tiny observations that might help them make everything even better. One, there were no towel rods near the sink, nowhere to put a handtowel. Also, unlike every hotel I've stayed in, there was no shower cap.Initially I was apprehensive a pet friendly hotel would show signs of pet hair, noise or other things a non-pet family might not tolerate. But the worse things I saw were some very cute dogs behaving extraordinarily well! Definitely not a problem."

Hotel was very clean and decorated nice. Comfortable bed. Staff was nice. Only bad part was they said the garage was full and we had to pay $27 to park our car for less than 24 hours. Would definitely stay there again though.

The Hotel Alexandria by Kimpton could not be further from that. It's a luxe joint that allows dogs of all sizes for free. The bed puts the Westin Dream bed to shame. There's complimentary wine happy hour with snacks. A gorgeous pool. The list goes on. You owe it to yourself to stay here!"

Finally, he dragged out the cart and stood there till I filled out the cart. He pushed the cart inside and stood there (like he is waiting for tip, which he did not desrve). I gave him my $2 and he looked as me as if he is just done saving my life through a critical heart surgery and that I am such a jerk I only paid him 2 dollars. He walked away without even saying ""Thank you!"". Also a night before our departure, we came to an uncleaned room at 5 pm (we left before 9 am for sight seeing and came back super tired), and when I called the front desk, he asked me ""do you want it to be cleaned?!"", Me: ""...of course"", and the response was ""no problem, I send someone to clean the room!"", not even an ""I am sorry!"". We have to hang outside in the hall way while it was being cleaned superfast in 5 minutes."

It is a very nice place to stay for younger people or people who do not have children. I say this because the surrounding area is really just filled with shops, bars and restaurants. There are no real attractions or things for children to do. Having children there was okay as the hotel does provide a children's time. If a person goes to DC to visit the Mall and the museums, I would suggest they stay closer to those attractions. Other than that, the area is beautiful and the restaurants were nice and the hotel was great. My only complaint of the hotel was there was a faint scent of urine at the door."

I would certainly recommend the hotel even for a longer stay. Transportation and the variety of dining choices were all in close proximity, easy access for any traveler."

However, this time around was not our usual pleasant experience. We had a unfortunate luck of being placed next door to a rude family with unruly children. The parents decided to take advantage of the wine reception, while leaving their two young children under the age of 10 alone to scream, bang on walls, slam doors and run up and down the hallways for hours. At one point one of the children rode the elevator down with my husband (a complete stranger) to find their mother. I will say the hotel staff did a great job locating their parents and handling the situation. Later in the evening, my husband was confronted by an intoxicated women wanting to join him in our hotel room. Needless to say, the wine reception was a spoil to our weekend. Great hotel and staff otherwise. Don't know that we will be returning again though!"

Can be pricey depending on what is going on in the area. Also, there is an additional charge for wifi and parking. The best thing was the wine happy hour and the free Sunday NYT."

The room was very comfortable for the few hours in which we were present. The front desk staff and valet's were very friendly and helpful. One tip...the adjacent restaurant (Jackson 20) was introduced to us as a place to get brunch the next day. We were looking forward to that, however when we approached the hostess for a table we were told that all tables were saved for those with reservations. It would have been nice to have been told that reservations were needed during our check-in process. Even better, front desk staff should offer to make those reservations for hotel guests."

So, I purposely chose Hotel Monaco given the wonderful d��cor, reminiscent of 1930s or 40s ""old Hollywood"", classic elegance, amenities, shopping and restaurants on King Street, high ratings, and affordable price.  The front desk staff was amazing, very gracious and personable.  When we needed extra bedding for the room, the staff responded right away.  Everyone was wonderfully gracious and kind.  We enjoyed shopping and dining on King Street, and we also took the King Street Trolley to the Metro Station for sightseeing in DC!  We enjoyed visiting the Smithsonian museums, the National Mall, the White House and Lincoln Memorial. My family was thrilled and said this was the most beautiful hotel they had every stayed in!"

The Hotel staff and service is absolutely wonderful but if you want to sleep in that is not going to happen. Housekeeping woke us up not once but twice. Once at 8am and next at 10am. Checkout is at 12pm but since they were so concerned we decided to checkout by 10:30am. To make matters even worse the vallet brought my car up front but wasn't there to give me the key as I stood out in the cold for 10 minutes. Not a good experience.P.S. Don't count on room service to be having a great meal as the menu suggests.

This is a 4 star hotel I should not be going thru this inconvenience for an expensive room, I had to reduce my stay. Bad experience."
1615,"The Alexandrian, Autograph Collection",Alexandria,2016-10-08T00:00:00Z,38.80474,-77.04455,2.0,"This hotel is not worthy of the limp Tom name. The staff was very nice but it stops there. I booked this hotel because it has a 4.5 rating and is a VIP + hotel on Expedia. It's a 3 star hotel at best and never once did I get a VIP treatment. To the contrary I think that since I booked through Expedia they have me the worst possible room in the entire hotel. Room was like a Marriott room which is fine but nothing special. It was next to the maintenance entrance so there was loud noise constantly. It was not prepared for my arrival and there was some kind of leak so an entire section of carpet was soaking wet. I would not recommend this hotel to anybody. I am also beginning to think that booking hotels through Expedia is a bad idea because I always get treated worse if I do. I'm a gold member w Expedia and I always get shafted when I book with them. This is the third time in a row I've had to complain to Expedia about their ""partner"" hotels."

The Hotel Monaco did not live up to the level of service I expected. When the shuttle dropped me off at the curbside of the hotel, no one helped with the luggage or even held the door open; this was 2pm in the afternoon. The desk clerks were short and not forthcoming with information about the area. When you are in town for only 24 hours, my time in town is precious and I would expect them to volunteer helpful information for a tourist. Then when we took the shuttle back to the airport and the driver had the music on loud while another passenger and myself were trying to have a conversation and he drove like a maniac. Very disappointed."

The staff was always courteous and attentive to any questions and request that I had.

It was super small ( we had a full bed instead of the queen size we paid for) and we could hear our neighbors practically breathing through the door/walls. Just be aware of what you're buying."

It's walking distance (though they have a shuttle if the altitude is hard on you) to the gondola into town. The restaurant overlooks the mountains and is a wall of glass. They arranged two functions for us and both were handled perfectly, even when I threw in extra people at the last minute. Chef Bud is great."

I noticed there was no water in the front lobby like most resorts have. No food available because it was off season (not even apples which most hotels offer as well). If we wanted anything to eat we would have had to drive into town. We had just driven 8 hours and it was snowing, so that wasn't something we wanted to do. Our room was very small with an option to be connected to the room next door if it was family. Since we didn't have family the door remained locked, but we could hear all the conversations, music and TV thru the door cracks. Coffee maker is stored under the sink in the bathroom. If you want to use it, you have to remove everything from the VERY SMALL counter space that is there. There is NO counter space in the room, only 4 drawers. View was nice from the windows, shower was nice. I requested a queen size bed, and got a double bed. My husband is 6'2 and his feet were hanging over the edge. Bed and mattress needed upgrading. Might be great for skiers who just want to ski and crash and not have any amenities or comfort. Even the main lodge had no where to sit and be comfy, as it was dark and had workmen in there cleaning. The young man checking us out was same person checking us in. He was pleasant."

If you wanted to watch TV you had to lay or seat on the bed. Using the coffee maker was impossible since on the sink was the only location adding risk if you were trying to get ready (teeth, etc) at the same time. There is a nook in the room which a shelf could easily be added for the coffee maker and ice bucket making room around the sink. In addition there is room for a chair in the room and would be easy to provide a lap desk (board to be placed on lap for laptop, etc). If you are going to use room as individual hotel room these should be a minimum since the main room is not available. I asked the front desk to have maintenance unlock the safe (locked shut by previous tenants) and they logged the request. Reminded them each morning and never done...on checkout the front desk did remove parking fees since this was not accomplished. In addition requested a temporary chair but never delivered. Front desk staff was great and did their job but beyond that nothing happened. Overall staff at desk, restaurant, and housekeeping were friendly and did an outstanding job. Expensive for such a poorly equipped room."

The blanket at the foot of the bed smelled like dirty feet....the maid left our room door wide open when she finished, and good thing we went back for an umbrella and found it this way, or it would have been open to anybody all day."

The property is beautiful. Very easy to get around Mountain Village and gondola access to Telluride. We stayed in the two bedroom condo this year and it was perfect for our family of four. The *only* complaint is the lack of parking. We were told they have 140 units and only 25 parking spaces so when they are busy its mandatory valet. We visited in the summer and had hiking, biking fishing day trips planned so it was somewhat of an inconvenience to have to rely on valet parking the first day. Mid week we were able to self park."

A couple of kinks-no wash clothes or face towels at check in and the bathroom fan did not work other than that it was a pleasant stay. ps.. they should also make it clear that you will be billed a 20. per day parking fee.

The manager offered us a bigger room, but since we only had one more night until we were off on our next great adventure, we decided to stay in the room we were in. The bed really needed to be replaced, it was way too soft. The valet service was a bit of a hassle, though they were quick about getting our vehicle to us. The dog fee was a bit steep. At least the stunning snow capped mountains surrounding the lodge was free. Thank goodness, because the view was priceless!"

The view was not at all as expected since all we could view was the gondola. The only other issue was lack of privacy as the folks that were on the gondola could see right into the room. I confirmed the view into the room from when my husband and I took the gondola ourselves. Perhaps the place was clean because you had the experience as though company was coming and on thei way.

Unfortunately we were a little bit late for the peak of that. The room we reserved was actually described on the web site as a tiny room -- surprisingly. Seemed to be a lock-off room that is part of a larger condo unit. It was by no means the smallest hotel room I have ever stayed in but was rather poorly designed, especially in the bathroom closet area. Finding the promised coffee maker was a bit of a challenge -- it was hidden in the cabinet under the sink. Similarly the one waste basket was hidden in a back corner behind the toilet. The toilet and bath/shower were in a separate compartment with a ridiculous door that was just about impossible to close. I didn't try. The shower/bath combo had sliding glass doors that made it very awkward to use also -- a curtain would have been far better. Much of the closet space was totally inaccessible with a floor mounted safe facing sideways -- would have been a challenge to use. The toilet was extraordinarily low, as was the one easy chair in the room. It took a long time for the electric wall heater to warm the room and its contents to a comfortable temperature tho it was not that cold outside yet. Other than this, it was a nice enough room with a decent view. Not only was there a hefty fee for parking, it turned out that valet parking was mandatory and that parking seemed in very short supply. Excellent hamburgers in the restaurant."

The hotel staff were extremely helpful with showing us how to use the gondolas and where the various hiking trail heads were located they even gave us an outstanding map. The main drawbacks of the hotel are the small size of the room and the lack of sound deadening between rooms. At check-in, the person tried to upgrade us to a larger room (for 60 more a night) however, since we were already paying over 200 a night, we declined to upgrade. Anyway, the room we were in was next to a utility room with a loud hot water heater that cycled on and off all night. Also, the walls were so thin that we could hear the conversations of the people next to us. To top it off, there were two rooms near us with barking dogs one two doors down and one right across the hall. We found out later that they put the people with pets on the first floor therefore, I suggest that you request a room off of the first floor if you don't want to hear pet noises. All-in-all the stay was fine but the amount of noise in the room was unacceptable."

1819,Americinn Coralville,Coralville,2015-12-15T00:00:00Z,41.70064,-91.607,4.0,"I was very comfortable and enjoyed the stay with the exception of check out time. I verified several times that check out was 11am. The housekeeping crew started pestering me around 10:20am. They hung out at my door the whole time I was trying to pack up and get ready to leave. The male even stepped very close to me asking if they could get into the room. I was very clear and said no. I will be out by 11am. I felt so pressed that I finally relented, thru all my belongings out the door and finished packing out in the parking lot. Needless to say I won't be staying there again. Other that the housekeeping pushing me out the door it was a nice stay. (I did complain at the front desk)"
1820,Americinn Coralville,Coralville,2016-01-30T00:00:00Z,41.70064,-91.607,2.0,"My stay was disappointing, to say the least. I had booked my room the afternoon of January 30th, and checked in that evening. Upon receiving the keys, my friends and I made our way to the room. Keys worked fine, but the door was deadbolted, which we thought odd. Turns out the hotel had double booked the room. The attendants were extremely confused and gave us keys to another, unbooked, room. In the morning the lobby was extremely unkept, and an employee was left at the front desk alone on his first day. Overall room cleanliness was great, with comfortable beds you expect with an Americinn. Management could use a lot of work."
1821,Americinn Coralville,Coralville,2016-03-14T00:00:00Z,41.70064,-91.607,5.0,"comfortable, clean, very quiet, up to date decor, nice staff. would have appreciated fruit choices for breakfast tho."
1822,Americinn Coralville,Coralville,2016-06-25T00:00:00Z,41.70064,-91.607,4.0,"Made reservations here because it had a hot tub, but it was obviously hasnt been working for a long time! Breakfast was limited. It was an ok stay, but hoped for better for the price."
1823,Americinn Coralville,Coralville,2015-10-23T00:00:00Z,41.70064,-91.607,4.0,"Everything was fine. The bathroom had some issues. The tub was not draining properly, and the ceiling needs attention. Girl at the desk said she'd put in a work order after I brought it to her attention. We stayed in a king room for 72. Not bad for the price, I wouldn't want to pay any more than that though."
1824,Americinn Coralville,Coralville,2016-09-22T00:00:00Z,41.70064,-91.607,4.0,"Fire alarms went off twice, from lighting. Each time we had to evacuate until fir dept arrive to clear alarms. Hope that doesn't happen again, but good to know they have our safety in mind."
1825,Americinn Coralville,Coralville,2016-06-09T00:00:00Z,41.70064,-91.607,3.0,"The hotel was very moderately priced, so I did not expect much other than comfort and cleanliness. The staff was very eager to help in any way. I left behind my cane, called the motel, and they were very helpful. Identified it and put it aside until my return three days later. The free breakfast was only average."
1826,Americinn Coralville,Coralville,2016-06-27T00:00:00Z,41.70064,-91.607,2.0,"Friendly receptionist Air in room didn't work, room had bad smell, sticky carpet and bathroom floor. Offered to switch me after maintenance could not be had."
1827,Americinn Coralville,Coralville,2016-03-10T00:00:00Z,41.70064,-91.607,3.0,"The Hot Tub was closed for starters. In the shower the soap was open and there was a half empty bottle of shampoo. There was no Hair Dryer and when we went to the front desk all we got was a sorry and there's nothing we can do, which doesn't do me any good when I have wet hair."
1828,Americinn Coralville,Coralville,2016-02-04T00:00:00Z,41.70064,-91.607,4.0,Would stay there again.
1829,Americinn Coralville,Coralville,2016-05-06T00:00:00Z,41.70064,-91.607,4.0,The one downside was that wifi very slow.
1830,Americinn Coralville,Coralville,2016-03-12T00:00:00Z,41.70064,-91.607,4.0,Wi-Fi was difficult to sign into for my kids devices
1831,Americinn Coralville,Coralville,2016-07-11T00:00:00Z,41.70064,-91.607,4.0,Was nice and clean. Staff was very friendly! Pool was a bit cold but the hot tub was great! Room was clean and comfortable! The breakfast was ok. The area is very convenient. Food places all around and the university of Iowa clinics were only 4 miles away!
1832,Americinn Coralville,Coralville,2016-06-25T00:00:00Z,41.70064,-91.607,3.0,Hot Tub was broken
1833,Americinn Coralville,Coralville,2016-06-04T00:00:00Z,41.70064,-91.607,1.0,Hotel is dirty. Pool was out of order. Elevator sounded like it was going to die. Room was filthy. Bathroom was disgusting
1834,Americinn Coralville,Coralville,2016-03-02T00:00:00Z,41.70064,-91.607,3.0,Breakfast was disappointing Out of waffle mix Juice machine broken Eggs cold
1835,Americinn Coralville,Coralville,2016-03-17T00:00:00Z,41.70064,-91.607,1.0,Room was dirty and in disrepair - not a value for the money.
1836,Americinn Coralville,Coralville,2016-02-27T00:00:00Z,41.70064,-91.607,3.0,"Hotels.com should really tell you if the facility's hot tub isn't functioning. During some trips, this has been a serious bummer when you go to check in and the hotel's hit tub isn't working. Same for pools. These are necessities when traveling with kiddos."
1837,Americinn Coralville,Coralville,2015-12-27T00:00:00Z,41.70064,-91.607,3.0,"I had 2 stays there (for a total of 3 nights) in the last week for business. The first stay was 2 nights, the hotel advertises for a hot tub which I was looking forward to...but it was closed because we just had to drain it and change the levels. The next night I came back, it was open but the hot tub was about the same temperature as the room, about the same temp as their pool, and had a better effect standing in a warm shower there. The 2nd visit I had was less than a week later and the hot tub was closed again. In their pool area there was no towels either and they don't give you very many towels to use in your room either. Not very happy with their housekeeping either."
1838,Americinn Coralville,Coralville,2016-07-15T00:00:00Z,41.70064,-91.607,1.0,Our stay was overshadowed by checking in late and discovering our room sheets had blood all over them. I went to the front desk to take the sheets back and see if they could make it right with us with no luck. Took my information so the manager could call us back but that never happened. Spent my night sleeping on the floor
1839,Americinn Coralville,Coralville,2016-06-03T00:00:00Z,41.70064,-91.607,1.0,"pool down, cable tv down 1/2 of 2 day stay, internet off on, fire alarm too. Am looking at other hotels next drive there"
1840,Americinn Coralville,Coralville,2016-08-16T00:00:00Z,41.70064,-91.607,3.0,The breakfast was not good. The had a problem with ants but it was cleaned up fairly quick.
1841,Americinn Coralville,Coralville,2016-05-20T00:00:00Z,41.70064,-91.607,3.0,"I was slightly disappointed in the hotel. The Hot Tub was broke, I had to constantly ask for towels as they only leave 2 in a room, and then they would ask a million questions before giving towels like they thought I was going to steal them. Hardly any water pressure in the shower, housekeeping came in and emptied garbage but didn't even make the bed, but they did take the extra towels I had just gotten :( Rather disappointed and I love AmericInns, did not feel Welcomed at all!"
1842,Americinn Coralville,Coralville,2016-06-17T00:00:00Z,41.70064,-91.607,3.0,"Watch for Fees! They charge extra for kids, and put a huge hold on your credit card beyond what you may for the room. The front desk staff were quite rude. Breakfast was lacking and not impressive and poorly lit. Hot tub closed during our visit. Close to shopping and attractions."
1843,Americinn Coralville,Coralville,2016-03-10T00:00:00Z,41.70064,-91.607,5.0,"I have been coming to this hotel for the last six years. The staff is always pleasant, the hotel room is always comfortable and clean. The location is great and easy to get to. And the icing of the cake is that every 10th visit is free. I recommend this hotel and will continue to stop in for the night... More"
1844,Americinn Coralville,Coralville,2016-07-20T00:00:00Z,41.70064,-91.607,4.0,Brought my aging mother for an early morning surgery the day of check out. I had a relaxing evening in the sauna and hot tub while watching auto racing while Mom read a book and relaxed and Dad turned in early. We unfortunately had to leave before breakfast but I know from past experience AmericInn provides a good one.
1845,Americinn Coralville,Coralville,2016-06-30T00:00:00Z,41.70064,-91.607,5.0,Great staff. Quite restful Location was great.
1846,Americinn Coralville,Coralville,2016-06-24T00:00:00Z,41.70064,-91.607,5.0,The hot tub was out of order but the pool was a religious experience with the beautiful view through the 3 story Windows. The breakfast was great!
1847,Americinn Coralville,Coralville,2016-10-07T00:00:00Z,41.70064,-91.607,3.0,"Clean room, next to highway, budget price for overnight stay"
1848,Americinn Coralville,Coralville,2016-01-04T00:00:00Z,41.70064,-91.607,2.0,"Heat didn't work in hotel room I was in and hot tub, yet again, remains out of service."
1849,Americinn Coralville,Coralville,2016-07-05T00:00:00Z,41.70064,-91.607,4.0,Comfortable and quiet. Property is showing its age but is adequate.
1850,Americinn Coralville,Coralville,2016-07-31T00:00:00Z,41.70064,-91.607,4.0,We were driving home and were too tired to drive any further. We wanted an affordable stay not far from our route. The AmericInn Coralville fit the bill. The room was great. Check in was easy. Breakfast was a let down: eggs were an inedible rubber and no fruit options.
1851,Americinn Coralville,Coralville,2016-02-09T00:00:00Z,41.70064,-91.607,2.0,Needs to outline policy for deposit fee online on all booking websites and also staff should verbally tell guests at check-in about the policy. I was unhappy with the room because it wasn't as nice as last time we stayed at this same hotel. We paid the same price before so I don't understand why last time our room was... More
1852,Americinn Coralville,Coralville,2016-06-27T00:00:00Z,41.70064,-91.607,4.0,"This was a decent hotel with a good-sized, clean guest room and airy public spaces, as well as a pool. It was easy to find near the highway exit, in a area where you can take a safe walk. Buffet breakfast was good, included scrambled eggs and sausage. The place seemed like a good choice for the money."
1853,Americinn Coralville,Coralville,2016-05-20T00:00:00Z,41.70064,-91.607,4.0,"Convenient location for our stay. We were there for 2 nights. Although convenient, the breakfast was the normal hotel fare, nothing to write home about."
1854,Americinn Coralville,Coralville,2016-05-06T00:00:00Z,41.70064,-91.607,1.0,"Bed Bugs!! We stayed here on 5/6/16 in room 309. Around 9:00 I decided to get the kids ready for bed and, based in the condition and cleanliness of the hotel, I decided to look under the sheets on the beds. Between the mattress pad and the fitted sheet, there were bed bugs crawling around...I didn't lift the mattress pad at that point. I called the front desk and told them there was a big problem in our room and when I mentioned the bed bugs, the front desk attendant did not seem surprised and said she would send the manager up to our room. The manager, too, did not seem surprised and said we could change rooms or get a refund. We left the hotel at 9:15 and went to another hotel in Iowa City."
1855,Americinn Coralville,Coralville,2016-04-24T00:00:00Z,41.70064,-91.607,3.0,"I booked a King suite they put us in a King room and showed me a Queen suite. The AC was not on at the hotel, though the desk clerk turned it on after I inquired about the heat and humidity. Desk clerks attempted to accommodate for hotel shortcomings (choice of room, extra towels, AC, etc.). Great service for an aging hotel. Okay if you only need to sleep and get going. Did not try breakfast -"
1856,Americinn Coralville,Coralville,2015-10-23T00:00:00Z,41.70064,-91.607,5.0,"There was a lot of clutter (cleaning supplies) in the hallway, but otherwise everything was great."
1857,Americinn Coralville,Coralville,2016-08-04T00:00:00Z,41.70064,-91.607,4.0,Had a terrible time checking in. Had booked with Hotels.com and werent even in the system at AmericInn..very disappointing after a long hot day!
1858,Americinn Coralville,Coralville,2016-02-14T00:00:00Z,41.70064,-91.607,3.0,Very disappointed in lighting in room. Also very poor breakfast. Refrigerator was 46 degrees making for warm milk and yogurt. Had to ask for biscuits.
1859,Americinn Coralville,Coralville,2016-02-25T00:00:00Z,41.70064,-91.607,5.0,"Thank you for having the pool open and water warm, even though it is winter. It was clean and very satisfying."
1860,Americinn Coralville,Coralville,2016-07-09T00:00:00Z,41.70064,-91.607,5.0,"Stayed here on our way home from Montana. Friendly staff, clean room, great breakfast and close to the highway. Really couldnt ask for much more!"
1861,Americinn Coralville,Coralville,2016-01-25T00:00:00Z,41.70064,-91.607,4.0,We visit the area often and find a clean newly renovated room here to be a great value. We can't find anything else this nice for the price when you do nonrefundable. Plus it's close to the Coralville mall and easy access from both I80 and close to I380.
1862,Americinn Coralville,Coralville,2015-11-01T00:00:00Z,41.70064,-91.607,4.0,Room was comfortable and clean but needs better lighting.
1863,Americinn Coralville,Coralville,2015-12-23T00:00:00Z,41.70064,-91.607,3.0,Hotel is under renovation but we had an old room and it showed. Beds were hard as a rock....lobby was full of old matresses.
1864,Americinn Coralville,Coralville,2016-08-06T00:00:00Z,41.70064,-91.607,2.0,"Employees were very unfriendly, reservation was incorrect, tried charging me twice for our room which was already paid for. Offered breakfast until 10 but we're out of almost everything by 9am. Poorly run location staffed with employees that couldn't seem to smile or even pretend to care about decent customer service-Thumbs waaaay down."
1865,Americinn Coralville,Coralville,2015-10-15T00:00:00Z,41.70064,-91.607,3.0,"When we entered the lobby, there was disassembled furniture stacked up everywhere with price tags on it. Looked like a flea market. The front desk staff was not very friendly. After checking in, we went up to our room to find it hadn't been cleaned. Better luck with the second room, but the sheets were old and had stains, as did the comforter and bed skirt. The housekeeping staff didn't change our sheets during our 3-night stay. Made us wonder if they had ever changed the sheets, frankly. A couple checking in the same time as us had to try 3 times to find a room that hadn't been slept in or had other people's stuff in it. Not good."
1866,Americinn Coralville,Coralville,2016-06-23T00:00:00Z,41.70064,-91.607,3.0,Great for the price
1867,Americinn Coralville,Coralville,2016-04-28T00:00:00Z,41.70064,-91.607,5.0,"We were quite please with the respect and ease we were treated with. To the point, that we may come to stay for our leisure time."
1868,Americinn Coralville,Coralville,2016-02-12T00:00:00Z,41.70064,-91.607,4.0,Great
1869,Americinn Coralville,Coralville,2016-01-16T00:00:00Z,41.70064,-91.607,4.0,friendly staff and very helpful!!! Nice POOL
1870,Americinn Coralville,Coralville,2016-08-13T00:00:00Z,41.70064,-91.607,4.0,"The food was not good, coffee was empty and there was minimum options to choose from."
1871,Americinn Coralville,Coralville,2015-12-12T00:00:00Z,41.70064,-91.607,5.0,Have stayed here before and get a lot for your money. Near the mall quit a few restaraunts from McDonald's to Red Lobster. Lots to choose from is also near the Hawkeye Express loading station.
1872,Americinn Coralville,Coralville,2016-06-07T00:00:00Z,41.70064,-91.607,1.0,"We checked in 5 minutes later we were at the front desk checking out!!! The sheets were stained outside, did not look inside... paint chipped off wall... swimming pool hot tub were non functional...."
1873,Americinn Coralville,Coralville,2016-08-17T00:00:00Z,41.70064,-91.607,4.0,got there very late and got told there was a 100 deposit despite already having paid for the room in advance. we were then told that the deposit would not be charged to our card but it was. then we were told it would drop off when we checked out in the morning it did not. we were already there on a tight budget and this just screwed up our entire trip. will not be staying there ever again despite the fact that the room was nice and clean but the air conditioner did not blow out cold air.
1874,Americinn Coralville,Coralville,2016-08-02T00:00:00Z,41.70064,-91.607,2.0,"It was an overnight travel stay. Our room was like a sauna. The sheets were wet, towels wet. Hotel staff said leave the air conditioner on, it'll get better. It didn't. As we left, Noticed water condensing on the outside wall on both sides of our window. No other window had it. Probably faulty condenser. Just made our stay miserable."
1875,Americinn Coralville,Coralville,2016-03-11T00:00:00Z,41.70064,-91.607,5.0,All was great. I had stayed at this same hotel 4 years earlier and it has not been worn down. Looks good and is comfortable. Breakfast is acceptable and tasty but nothing fancy. Nice for a stay before travelling on. Only complaint was that the hot tub was being repaired/fixed and it sounded like it might be a while until the parts they needed arrived at the hotel.
1876,Americinn Coralville,Coralville,2016-06-22T00:00:00Z,41.70064,-91.607,5.0,"My wife and I enjoyed this lovely hotel. Clean, refreshing, and friendly are just a few amenities. Enjoyed the comfortable bed and the room overall. This hotel is in a nice area with shopping and dining that will enlighten."
1877,Americinn Coralville,Coralville,2016-03-10T00:00:00Z,41.70064,-91.607,3.0,Enjoyed stay wish I would have known ahead of time that the hot tub wasn't working.
1878,Americinn Coralville,Coralville,2016-03-04T00:00:00Z,41.70064,-91.607,3.0,The breakfast was very poor. The eggs were still mostly frozen. White bread only.
1879,Americinn Coralville,Coralville,2016-07-16T00:00:00Z,41.70064,-91.607,3.0,Good value for the price. Hotel staff was friendly and room was clean. I would say it's a solid 3 star. Breakfast included was also a nice perk.
1880,Americinn Coralville,Coralville,2016-05-25T00:00:00Z,41.70064,-91.607,4.0,"Even though breakfast was served starting at 6, coffee was cold. Wonder if it was from the day before."
1881,Americinn Coralville,Coralville,2016-06-19T00:00:00Z,41.70064,-91.607,4.0,We had a great stay. We had an issue when we first checked in by they quickly got it fixed. Great stay. We have stayed at this hotel several times in the last 5 years and are always treated nicely. It is close to all the places we usually go so it works out great.
1882,Americinn Coralville,Coralville,2016-03-15T00:00:00Z,41.70064,-91.607,5.0,"Had issues checking in but that was the fault of hotels.com. Hotel was well maintained, good WiFi, good breakfast, quiet. Only wish they would have had a fruit choice for breakfast! We would definitely stay at this property again."
1883,Americinn Coralville,Coralville,2015-12-11T00:00:00Z,41.70064,-91.607,3.0,"Good price. Hallways were dirty. Not a welcoming lobby...poor lighting, lobby in disarray..no furniture."
1884,Americinn Coralville,Coralville,2016-06-02T00:00:00Z,41.70064,-91.607,5.0,My first time at Americinn Property - I was driving cross-country and found it clean and quite nice. Usually I lok to Comfort Inn or LaQuinta chains and found this right in line for nice hotel in mid-price range. I would stay at this hotel again.
1885,Americinn Coralville,Coralville,2016-07-27T00:00:00Z,41.70064,-91.607,1.0,"First of all, there was only one person at the front desk, and we had to stand in line for a 1/2 hour to check in. Our room was nonsmoking, and it stunk with stale smoke. Thank goodness the p-tac unit worked to help air out the room. The shower was barely a drizzle. The elevator sounded like it was on it's last leg. Breakfast was not impressive at all. Every day when we returned from the hospital after being there for over 12 hours, our key didn't work, and we had to go back down to the desk to get it reprogrammed. Our room was on the top floor, and the furthest from the elevator."
1886,Americinn Coralville,Coralville,2016-08-03T00:00:00Z,41.70064,-91.607,3.0,"The lobby was hot, the beds were extremely uncomfortable, the bathroom in the room was not clean. The breakfast was mediocre (that is probably a generous description). The pool and hot tub we're large, perfect temperature and enjoyable."
1887,Americinn Coralville,Coralville,2016-07-31T00:00:00Z,41.70064,-91.607,1.0,Buyer beware they charged my card twice and I am having a difficult time getting them to reverse the charges !!!!!! The WIFI doesnt work ask them to check it never called back

1890,Americinn Coralville,Coralville,2016-07-21T00:00:00Z,41.70064,-91.607,3.0,"Hot day (94 outside), hotel lobby was only slightly cooler. My first room the air was not working. The man at the front desk was polite, but it took him 40 minutes to get me to a new room. He said it was his second day and I was curious why the hotel would leave him alone with very little experience."
1891,Americinn Coralville,Coralville,2016-06-13T00:00:00Z,41.70064,-91.607,4.0,"This is a good hotel for an inexpensive rate. I will stay here again and recommend it. It is clean and reasonably updated for the price. Breakfast is typical for a hotel, but nice to have included. Hot tub out of order."
1892,Americinn Coralville,Coralville,2016-10-12T00:00:00Z,41.70064,-91.607,4.0,Good place to stay

I needed to move one of the dressers, and there were a lot of dust bunnies and some dead bugs behind it. Also, you could hear pipes banging in the wall in the room I was in which was not a huge deal for me but may be for others. I didn't know what it was at first, so I asked the guy at the front desk to come check it out. He was very helpful and nice. All the staff were very friendly. However, I will probably not be staying at another AmericInn and cannot recommend it due to the 100 dollar authorization hold that took about a week to come off of my bank account. I've never had a hold for that long while staying at a hotel. All in all it was a minor inconvenience and did not break the bank for me, but I don't think a hold needs to last that long. I called AmericInn about it, and the lady on the phone told me that it depends on however you paid and that it can take 3-10 days for the hold to come off. I think AmericInn should definitely look into this and expedite the process so people don't have money tied up in a hold."

Not much to do or see within walking distance. They have a pool but we didn't use it. I would stay here again and would recommend to families. Price was average for the time of year.

They were clean, accommodating, and a helpful staff. We found the biggest drawback was the stiff mattress and thin pillows, but overall a good value for the money. There is also a 100 deposit when you check in, so be prepared for that charge."

She had just checked me into that room an hour earlier. But other than that, nice hotel and good location."
1921,Americinn Coralville,Coralville,2016-10-07T00:00:00Z,41.70064,-91.607,5.0,I was very impressed with this motel. I have never stayed at a Microtel location before. From now on it will be my first choice.

We were at first given a room on the 1st floor. When my husband went to check it out he found crickets in the room. He caught 2 but didn't know how many were left. We asked for a different room and were promptly moved to the 2nd floor. This room was great, no noise, comfy beds and pillows. The night clerk was apologetic and immediately found us a better room. We would stay there again."

Road noise was horrible when the window was open to let out smoke smell because of allergies. Hotel amenities the worst ever encountered e.g., no bottled water on the premises. I was told to go to a local service station to get some."

We were disappointed the hot tub wasn't working but understand things like that happen. The halls smelled like smoke but our room was fine so we could live with that. Not pleased that the outside doors at the ends of the building weren't locked...not good security. We will definitely stay again though."

We stayed there Friday through Sunday for a wrestling tournament and chose this hotel for the location and because the whole team was staying there. The halls reaked of marijuana and cigarette smoke, I had a sweet with 2 beds no Jacuzzi tub like I was supposed to and an empty room for some odd reason. When I brought it up to management about the smell he was as high as could be and told me it was incense burning but he would take his special spray and spray down the hall. The other awful thing is people live her. A lot of people hang out outside so you don't feel safe. I want my money back."

Poor condition, dirty windows, something sticky in the carpet. Continental breakfast area was extremely dirty, trash can overflowing, food all over the floor and no hotel employee cleaning it up. We had no wash clothes in our room and almost took an act of congress to get some. People living in an RV in the parking lot, broke down car in lot as well."

The staff did all they could to keep this hotel from becoming a complete sh*hole. Pool was small and had dirty walls (look like staff tried to clean it but couldn't do to either lacl of proper resources or age, hot tub was disgusting. The grounds and rooms were kept up by great staff. Josh and other desk agents were beyond helpful but once again owners/management let them down (for example, I needed to print boarding passes, something needed by every traveler. They had a business center but guests can not print there. Why that is in 2016 is beyond me. So Josh offered to print for me, then asked if I wanted a second copy (because you never know, great thought - I didn't even think to ask, but he did)). So now he has to take care of my printing while running the front desk and he and everyone there did it with a smile. All the owners needed to do was buy and hook up a printer, such a small thing but makes all the difference. Staff gave great recommendations on where to eat and find things, again with a smile and not rushed. 5 star customer service on a 3 star property. Pay someone to really clean the pool and hot tub! Btw pool is really small, not good for kids."

The location however is fantastic and the view of the Rocky mountains is spectacular. So much so, that some guests basically camp out in the evening off the back parking lot which is built like a sun deck. I will definitely stay here on future trips. The hotel is located at the back of a cul-de-sac of 5 hotels which curves around a hill where one lane ends halfway back. I was turned around twice the first day I arrived and I fancy myself a good judge of directions."

The pool and hot tub are FILTHY, and I would not recommend anyone getting into them. The hotel has an overall musty scent. Our room door would not lock. At all. Even from the inside. They did repair this pretty quickly, I must say. The bed sheets had cigarette burns on them. The beds were uncomfortable. The pillows are super cheap and worn out. Not a comfortable stay at all."

Hotel smelled a little funny, one of our colleagues stated that it may have been marijuana. The heater in our room gave off a burning smell that lingered. The deck by the pool felt like it was in a back alley which did nothing for comfort. The complementary breakfast consisted of waffles, cereal and fruit which left something to be desired in terms of variety. Overall this hotel is good for a one night stay for the price but would not recommend for long term visits."

The bed had someone else's barette stuck between the sheets, so we don't know how well the beds were changed, if at all.

We took the food out, cleaned the microwave, but the smell was still overwhelming. Finally just took the whole microwave, and coffee pot (which had old coffee left in it) down to the front desk.

2032,Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel,New Orleans,2016-01-14T00:00:00Z,29.962454,-90.06636,5.0,"Great breakfast buffet w/ hot eggs, bacon, sausage, waffles, etc . Staff very friendly helpful in booking tours, providing maps and giving directions. Location just 4 blocks from Bourbon St and 3 blocks from Hop on Hop off double decker bus which was a great bargain 39 good for 3 days. Only minus was the street is all torn up as they are putting in rails for a new street car line. Also the rooms could use a little spiffing up."
2033,Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel,New Orleans,2015-11-26T00:00:00Z,29.962454,-90.06636,4.0,Hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. All of their suggestions were very good.
2034,Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel,New Orleans,2015-11-14T00:00:00Z,29.962454,-90.06636,3.0,"Its location, N. Rampart, puts it at the border of the French Quarter. The location is a short stroll way from the partying of Bourbon Street and Frenchman Street. Could use some updating: broken railings (including on 3rd floor which could be dangerous), mold in shower area, poor lighting. Staff was very polite and helpful."

The rooms were a bit small but not an issue for me. The breakfast was pretty yummy and it was very convenient to have a bar at the hotel (something to do while my friends finished some work). I will definitely recommend this place!

2042,Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel,New Orleans,2016-02-04T00:00:00Z,29.962454,-90.06636,3.0,"Overall nice Hotel, nice area. Rooms are small if your tall you may want to avoid the bathroom, the water pressure is really low and the water is kind of slimy sticks with your skin after your dry. I've stayed at other Hotels in NOLA and can't blame the water source. Parking is a bit cramped if you drive a SUV or Truck be careful. Breakfast is good for being FREE but I would rather eat at many of the great restaurants...courtyard area is nice as is the bar. they also have no security and the rooms doors face out anyone can't just walk in and out on this property. The street where the hotel sits is under major construction so lobby and bar are covered in dust. Staff of the hotel were good allowed me to check in early. Like I said Hotel was decent would not however be my first choice more of a back up plan."
2043,Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel,New Orleans,2016-07-07T00:00:00Z,29.962454,-90.06636,3.0,"Like a previous review, we found parking to be very tight and were thankful for an employee who parked our car. There was a slight room mix-up but we were comped for the parking because of it- thanks. Our room door stuck a lot but we managed. We had to leave too early for breakfast so I can't comment on it. Being an old hotel, the room was quite small but the bathroom had been well renovated. I also wish the bar would have been open the night we were there."
2044,Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel,New Orleans,2016-03-14T00:00:00Z,29.962454,-90.06636,3.0,"We had a street view. There is construction going on extending the streetcar. Not the hotels fault, but they do start at 7am. If you plan on sleeping in past 7 do not get the street view. Also we had a Sysco delivery truck pull up out front at 5:00 am on our last day, the trucks engine ran until 6:15am then the driver got out his hand truck and loaded the hand truck, scanning every box, making a very loud noise. There should be a back or side entrance for deliveries, not in the front directly under the windows of the patrons paying a lot of money for the stay. It was very rude, and for that reason I would not recommend staying at this location."
2045,Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel,New Orleans,2015-12-08T00:00:00Z,29.962454,-90.06636,3.0,The location is very nice-just 3 blocks from Bourbon Street. There is a lot of construction going on in front of the hotel but didn't affect our stay. Staff was very nice and the breakfast had a nice variety. The elevator is extremely small-my husband and i with 3 suitcases filled it up. The bathroom layout was very odd. A large bathroom but the sink was outside the bathroom. There was only 1 small light in the bathroom and made the shower area very dark. The shower had NO water pressure at all. The pillows in the room were very uncomfortable and was like sleeping on tiny little rocks. Did not get a good night sleep. Overall wouldn't stay again unless there wasn't another choice.
2046,Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel,New Orleans,2016-03-25T00:00:00Z,29.962454,-90.06636,4.0,"Basic, updated 1960s-70s facility, quiet, walking distance to the Quarter and Treme, across from Louis Armstrong Park, close to Basin Street Station, clean, nice people, ought to be very very busy once the Rampart Street trolley line is open this year."

Nothing to crazy, clean and well kept. The staff was super cool! We honeay do believe that our room had a spirit in it, I personally didn't get messed w... I might of but I had way too much hydration in me to notice anything. One of the girls swears she was watched the whole night and didn't sleep but 20 mins in the middle of the day, the other girl w us had her feet played with. No joke! Nothing scary happened but isent this what Nola is all about We didn't mind out friendly ghost In our room. Over all we had a great stay and I would definitely be back!"
2048,Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel,New Orleans,2016-05-08T00:00:00Z,29.962454,-90.06636,4.0,"We stayed for my husband's birthday. It was a convenient walk to the French Quarter and the staff was more than welcoming and always willing to help. Breakfast is free and quite satisfying. The rooms are quite small but very clean and comfortable. We had a courtyard view of the pool and it was very nice. Although it was a bit more pricey, it was worth the money."
2049,Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel,New Orleans,2016-05-07T00:00:00Z,29.962454,-90.06636,3.0,The room was either really cold or hot. The bathroom wasn't very clean. Bed was comfy. Continental breakfast was better than average. There were more options than usual by they weren't that tasty. They were going through a bit of construction that kept it noisy outside our room.

Room was very clean, but had a musty smell - normal for such an old building. Charming courtyard. Really tight self parking - and expect to pay 30 for it, with in/out privileges - but ultimately worth it because finding parking is a nightmare in this area. Good breakfast - scrambled eggs, sausage, bagels, cereal, granola yogurt. Check out at noon is a plus. Safe and quiet area, close to everything. I would stay here again for a French Quarter visit."

The hotel is very nice, right there in French Quarter, but not at the noisy main street. Only 3 blocks to walk and you are in the middle of it all! Breakfast was very nice too! Hotel has charming feeling, and staff was vey friendly. The only issue I had, was the fan/AC noise, from unit of the room. As I was sleeping right next to it, and I am also a very light sleeper...turned it off one night, and then no problems to sleep. Also noticed the street noise, like garbage truck, can be a nuisance if your room is on the street side like ours. Recommend this !"

2226,Wine Valley Lodge,Napa,2016-06-22T00:00:00Z,38.283329,-122.288533,4.0,"This place was great. I was there for business and didn't need an extravagant facility. It was clean, the people were friendly and it had a convenient location to downtown Napa. I would definitely stay there again."
2227,Wine Valley Lodge,Napa,2016-06-20T00:00:00Z,38.283329,-122.288533,3.0,very kind and friendly
2228,Wine Valley Lodge,Napa,2016-06-16T00:00:00Z,38.283329,-122.288533,5.0,"This little lodge worked out perfect for us. It reminded me of a little hacienda. It was neat, clean, quiet and the beds were incredibly comfortable!! The continental breakfast was good too. If you are used to having five star treatment then you probably won't like this place. We were in Napa for the Brian Culbertson Jazz Festival and knew we would not be spending much time at all in whatever hotel we stayed in. All I insisted on was a clean, inexpensive and centrally located place to stay. The Wine Valley Lodge was centrally located between all of the venues we attended. Not a far walk from downtown Napa and very close to all necessities i.e. gas station, market and eateries. The price per night was right up my alley! I would definitely stay there again."
2229,Wine Valley Lodge,Napa,2016-05-28T00:00:00Z,38.283329,-122.288533,4.0,"I'd stay again if passing through. The facilities were clean, functional and tidy."

2231,Wine Valley Lodge,Napa,2016-06-30T00:00:00Z,38.283329,-122.288533,4.0,"nice , quiet little old style motel with updates. Nice pool and convenient to everything."
2232,Wine Valley Lodge,Napa,2016-09-14T00:00:00Z,38.283329,-122.288533,3.0,"Great home base for wineries. Easy to Uber or walk 1 mile to downtown Napa for restaurants, tasting rooms shops. Hotel is a little beat up, but saved was well spent on fantastic wine. Helpful staff at motel."
2233,Wine Valley Lodge,Napa,2016-07-12T00:00:00Z,38.283329,-122.288533,5.0,The staff were very friendly and made you feel very comfortable. I would highly recommend this place to my friends and family.
2234,Wine Valley Lodge,Napa,2016-06-13T00:00:00Z,38.283329,-122.288533,3.0,Room was clean although pool was mostly used by birds for bathing and toileting. It worked since we didn't spend a lot of time at hotel. You come to Napa for wine so it suited our needs just fine
2235,Wine Valley Lodge,Napa,2016-06-03T00:00:00Z,38.283329,-122.288533,2.0,Good place for budget. No frills hotel with just the basics and nice staff. It's our go-to place in Napa and allows us to spend our cash on great wines.
2236,Wine Valley Lodge,Napa,2016-06-08T00:00:00Z,38.283329,-122.288533,4.0,Nice stay away from the heat!
2237,Wine Valley Lodge,Napa,2016-07-10T00:00:00Z,38.283329,-122.288533,1.0,"During my stay I needed to have an extra bed. I had to pay an additional 100 for the additional bed and I ended getting the worst room in the hotel. A room for a disabled person. That not only wasn't clean, but was very bad smell. The room was very hot and even though we had air conditioner, appeared that was not working correctly and still very hot at night."
2238,Wine Valley Lodge,Napa,2016-07-02T00:00:00Z,38.283329,-122.288533,4.0,"Room was clean, fresh paint and quiet. Close to downtown and near"
2239,Wine Valley Lodge,Napa,2016-09-12T00:00:00Z,38.283329,-122.288533,5.0,Simple yet elegant room for the cost.
2240,Wine Valley Lodge,Napa,2016-07-01T00:00:00Z,38.283329,-122.288533,4.0,"Quiet, clean, comfortable, well located motel with good wifi, sparkling swimming pool and extended breakfast hours."
2241,Wine Valley Lodge,Napa,2016-07-02T00:00:00Z,38.283329,-122.288533,5.0,The hotel clerk Judy was so helpful with information and friendliness she made us feel like family. But the next day a different clerk was rude! We had an emergency during the night and had to leave. We called back the next day and she was so unconcerned and unfriendly. I guess Judy spoiled us.
2242,Wine Valley Lodge,Napa,2016-10-12T00:00:00Z,38.283329,-122.288533,5.0,"Judy was the person I spoke with on the phone, before we went. She was so helpful. When we arrived, she was the hostess. Directed us to hot air balloon ride, wine trip. Very knowledgeable of the area. Very laid back motel."
2243,Wine Valley Lodge,Napa,2016-07-19T00:00:00Z,38.283329,-122.288533,4.0,"Great stay. Nothing extremely special and included breakfast was so so. Reception was friendly, rooms were clean."
2244,Wine Valley Lodge,Napa,2016-06-12T00:00:00Z,38.283329,-122.288533,4.0,"We have family in Napa and visit frequently. This motel is older but well managed and clean.The rooms are a little small. The staff is very nice and knowledgable about the area. The breakfast is cereal, packaged pastries, toast and microwave sausage egg and cheese croissant which was quite good. There is also yogurt, fruit, juice and a coffee machine with several choices. Hotels in Napa are expensive so I consider this motel to be quite a bargain."
2245,Wine Valley Lodge,Napa,2016-06-10T00:00:00Z,38.283329,-122.288533,4.0,"This was a good value in the Napa area. It is not located downtown with the restaurants, shops, etc, but is convenient to the freeway and other major streets.The grounds are nicely kept with roses everywhere, the pool area looked nice but it was too cold when we were there to enjoy that. The room was clean, the bed was comfortable the bathroom was a little small, but ok for two people."
2246,Wine Valley Lodge,Napa,2016-07-14T00:00:00Z,38.283329,-122.288533,4.0,Only complaint is lack of coffee maker in the room (and lobby!) and the noise level between rooms. Nothing too bad but you definitely know when someone is next store. Pool is small but clean and fairly warm! Loved the ease of parking and availability of maps and coupons for tastings in the lobby.
2247,Wine Valley Lodge,Napa,2016-06-18T00:00:00Z,38.283329,-122.288533,4.0,"It was just a quick trip to sleep and move on for the next day, but it served the most important purpose. The bed was very comfortable with lots of pillows. The AC was great, and clean room. The continental breakfast was good too, and in a private dining area."
2248,Wine Valley Lodge,Napa,2016-08-09T00:00:00Z,38.283329,-122.288533,4.0,"Very nice room. Clean, comfortable. no frills"
2249,Wine Valley Lodge,Napa,2016-04-30T00:00:00Z,38.283329,-122.288533,4.0,"The hotel receptionist provided great recommendations for dinner and wine tour/tasting. Internet was a little slow, but AC worked really well (getting the room down to 54 degrees in about an hour) and the bathroom was well laid out with lots of room."
2250,Wine Valley Lodge,Napa,2016-05-31T00:00:00Z,38.283329,-122.288533,4.0,"the room was well appointed. there was a large bathroom with a large shower, plenty of towels and lots of light. the room was quiet and the breakfast generous. we would come back here again."
2251,Wine Valley Lodge,Napa,2016-07-09T00:00:00Z,38.283329,-122.288533,5.0,It was great place to stay with my family!!!! The picture on the internet don't you how nice is the place. When I choose that hotel I wasn't sure if it was going to be a good one because of the picture!!!!! It was the best hotel to stay after all!!!!good price You shoud up date that pic!!!!
2252,Wine Valley Lodge,Napa,2016-07-08T00:00:00Z,38.283329,-122.288533,4.0,"This is not a fancy motel, but it is very clean and comfortable. Very good bed and very clean. Recommend."
2253,Wine Valley Lodge,Napa,2016-06-01T00:00:00Z,38.283329,-122.288533,5.0,"Combination business and high school graduation. The only disappointment was no coffee service/equipment in the room and the machine in the lobby was a very long slow process. If they are going to do lobby only, they need to brew in larger volume and put out the pumps as so many other motels are doing across the country."
2254,Wine Valley Lodge,Napa,2016-06-19T00:00:00Z,38.283329,-122.288533,4.0,"Every thing at the hotel (it is really a motel) was pleasant except the office smelled of curry. Although I love curry, the reception area should not have such aromas. Also, although the room was very clean and comfortable, there was a very strong smell of disinfectant. When we arrived, the room was already opened I believed to air out the disinfactant smell. Apart from these two set backs, the motel is pleasant and clean."
2255,Wine Valley Lodge,Napa,2016-10-09T00:00:00Z,38.283329,-122.288533,5.0,Our stay was very good. This is an excellent value for the Napa area. We were pleasantly surprised and would stay there again.

2265,Wine Valley Lodge,Napa,2016-05-24T00:00:00Z,38.283329,-122.288533,5.0,Went for the wine tasting. Lovely old timey hotel all updated. Easy drive downtown to catch public 10 vine bus to wineries from here. Near to grocery. Loved this place. Front desk helpful with diections.
2266,Wine Valley Lodge,Napa,2016-05-23T00:00:00Z,38.283329,-122.288533,5.0,"Excellent and reasonably - priced place (compared to other places in the region) in a very convenient location. Perfect spot to explore both Napa and Sonoma. Lodge was clean, king size bed very comfortable, and overall spacious enough for this type of room. Breakfast was quite good, with a gourmet coffee machine with many choices, yogurt, fruit, cereal, bagels, bread, spreads, and egg/ham croissants. Thank you to Judy who was very helpful and gave me great info on how to explore Sonoma County and even to Bodega Bay. We did what she recommended, and had an awesome day! She also recommended 3 different places for dinner, all of which were excellent. Overall, highly satisfied with Wine Valley Lodge and will definitely stay here again!"
2267,Wine Valley Lodge,Napa,2016-06-08T00:00:00Z,38.283329,-122.288533,4.0,Easy Check-in and convenient parking right outside our room. A traditional Motel which look like it has recently been updated. Good value for the price and the simple breakfast was pleasant and the coffee a quality brew. Recommended.
2268,Wine Valley Lodge,Napa,2016-05-01T00:00:00Z,38.283329,-122.288533,4.0,"Upgraded rooms with comfortable beds, refrigerator, easy parking, and close to downtown Napa."
2269,Wine Valley Lodge,Napa,2016-05-28T00:00:00Z,38.283329,-122.288533,3.0,Everything was fine except when we went into the room it had a musty smell. The bathroom had been completely remodeled which was very nice but water pressure was very low. Staff were wonderful.
2270,Wine Valley Lodge,Napa,2016-08-07T00:00:00Z,38.283329,-122.288533,3.0,"I rarely stayed in the room, so I didn't need much. Mostly I just wanted a quiet, comfortable place to sleep that didn't break the bank. Wine Valley Lodge did exactly that."
2271,Wine Valley Lodge,Napa,2016-09-04T00:00:00Z,38.283329,-122.288533,5.0,Shopping centers for food and to eat were within walking distance for me. Great location due to the reason that it was quiet and next to a trail for individuals to walk to. Great service and I really enjoyed it!
2272,Wine Valley Lodge,Napa,2016-07-16T00:00:00Z,38.283329,-122.288533,4.0,good location for our trip
2273,Wine Valley Lodge,Napa,2016-06-24T00:00:00Z,38.283329,-122.288533,3.0,We were looking for a quick getaway just to relax and we found it! This hotel is clean and the right price. Staff was excellent and morning breakfast allowed us to sleep in and not worry about having to drive somewhere for food. We saved enough money to buy nice wine for home so we were happy! We were on our Harley Davidson road king so we had a perfect weekend! I hope the same for you!
2274,Wine Valley Lodge,Napa,2016-06-08T00:00:00Z,38.283329,-122.288533,5.0,The owners spoke every morning. They were engaging and caring. Beds were so comfortable. Microwave and refrigerator in room ..In a quiet neighborhood..nice surroundings..in walking distance to shops and restaurants
2275,Wine Valley Lodge,Napa,2016-09-07T00:00:00Z,38.283329,-122.288533,4.0,Very nice Basic lodgings. Room clean and comfortable. staff very personable.
2276,Wine Valley Lodge,Napa,2016-05-27T00:00:00Z,38.283329,-122.288533,3.0,"We stayed here for the Bottle Rock music festival at the Napa Fairgrounds. It was about a mile away. Great location and close to downtown Napa. While the room was a bit small, it suited our needs just fine. The free breakfast was okay. The line for the coffee machine was long because it was one of those complicated things that you had to choose which type of coffee or espresso you wanted and then wait for it to pour. No milk or half n half, just flavored creamers."
2277,Wine Valley Lodge,Napa,2016-07-14T00:00:00Z,38.283329,-122.288533,4.0,Alls good for the price

2280,Wine Valley Lodge,Napa,2016-07-31T00:00:00Z,38.283329,-122.288533,4.0,"Motel is a very basic but in good condition and recetly remodeled. It is nothing fancy but has been recently remodeled and the management works hard at maintaining it. Beds were very comfortable and the room had everything (refrigerator, micro) but lacked a coffee pot but breakfast was served in the morning across from the office. Wish the pool was heated though since it would have been nice to take a dip latter in day after wine tasting in Napa."
2281,Wine Valley Lodge,Napa,2016-07-19T00:00:00Z,38.283329,-122.288533,3.0,"Cheap , affordable and very quite hotels. Breakfast was meh , staff is alright and the room is quite comforting."

2283,Wine Valley Lodge,Napa,2016-08-15T00:00:00Z,38.283329,-122.288533,4.0,"We chose here for a budget stay at Napa Valley. Upon checking in we were very pleased by the friendliness of the staff. Arriving late in the afternoon, we were given great suggestions on how to make the most out of the remaining time. When we left the next day, we had forgotten a mobile charger in the room, but the lodge kindly offered to mail it to us. Great service."
2284,Wine Valley Lodge,Napa,2016-06-24T00:00:00Z,38.283329,-122.288533,2.0,"This hotel had only two large towels, and no coffee service in room. The bed however was comfortable. The hotel is in a rundown old neighborhood. The continental breakfast was skimpy, and didn't open until 7 am. We decided to eat breakfast elsewhere after looking at what was there. I would not recommend this hotel. ( I am not a picky person either)."
2285,Wine Valley Lodge,Napa,2016-04-28T00:00:00Z,38.283329,-122.288533,3.0,"Was a good budget hotel, however the rooms need serious updating. Walls are thin and you could hear conversation of people in the room next to you. Room was clean. Pool area looked nice but was too cold to enjoy. Breakfast was disappointing...coffee machine, cereal, danishes, and yogurt."
2286,Wine Valley Lodge,Napa,2016-07-29T00:00:00Z,38.283329,-122.288533,5.0,"Pleasantly surprised, as my expectations weren't very high. Bed was super comfortable. Nicely redone bathroom with granite. Very clean. Would definitely stay here again."

2289,Wine Valley Lodge,Napa,2016-07-10T00:00:00Z,38.283329,-122.288533,4.0,"My family of four stayed at the Wine Valley Lodge for 3 nights. We liked this place because it fit our budget and the location is excellent - easy access to the highways for Napa and Sonoma wine valley drives, and 5 minutes to downtown Napa for restaurants, cafes and shops. There is also a CVS on the corner within walking distance and across the boulevard from CVS there's a shopping strip with a supermarket, pizza restaurant, laundromat, and other conveniences. We have no complaints about the motel-style Wine Valley Lodge. Our room was clean, the 2 Queen sized beds were very comfortable, our mini-fridge and TV worked just fine, and we appreciated the heated outdoor pool and the free daily continental breakfast, served 7am - 10am. The front desk staff and the housekeeping staff were courteous and friendly too."

All the staff we encountered were very nice. The location was convenient, we could walk to a few restaurants and drug stores. The continental breakfast was way above average with hot meat-egg-cheese sandwiches for those who like it plus toast, cereal, yogurt, and fresh fruit."
2293,Wine Valley Lodge,Napa,2016-10-27T00:00:00Z,38.283329,-122.288533,2.0,"Needs to be updated. Paint was chipped in the walls, furniture looked outdated. Loud neighbors. You can hear everything"

2297,Wine Valley Lodge,Napa,2016-08-24T00:00:00Z,38.283329,-122.288533,3.0,"Friendly and accommodating, and a good value for the price. Very nice staff and satisfying breakfast served every morning. Everything looked and felt clean except the carpet, which felt grimy and oily under my feet. Hotels like this are often stingy with towels, but here, as also is often the case, you are welcome to more if you ask."

2302,Wine Valley Lodge,Napa,2016-07-07T00:00:00Z,38.283329,-122.288533,4.0,"The hotel is nice and in a quiet area, not luxury, but comfortable and within distance of Napa Valley"
2303,Wine Valley Lodge,Napa,2016-10-19T00:00:00Z,38.283329,-122.288533,4.0,They thought it was fine
2304,Wine Valley Lodge,Napa,2016-10-24T00:00:00Z,38.283329,-122.288533,3.0,This is a great budget choice. Old style motel charm. Clean and safe with a friendly staff.
2305,Wine Valley Lodge,Napa,2016-10-13T00:00:00Z,38.283329,-122.288533,4.0,"Typical road motel that hasn't been updated in awhile but the rooms are clean and the beds are comfortable. If you're looking for luxury, elegance, and price-gouged frou frou accommodations, go someplace else. If you're smart, and would rather spend your hard-earned money on fine wine and dining as well as on pampering yourself (Calistoga mud baths!), this is a safe clean place to lay down your head. Just a short 3 minute drive to downtown Napa, and easy access to the main highway leading to all the wineries. Surprisingly good coffee. The free breakfast is enough to get you on the road but the breakfast itself is fairly mediocre."
2306,Wine Valley Lodge,Napa,2016-05-12T00:00:00Z,38.283329,-122.288533,5.0,"The hotel was very quaint and nice. The beds were so comfortable. A great, inexpensive place to stay. Will definitely book this place again."

2309,Wine Valley Lodge,Napa,2016-09-15T00:00:00Z,38.283329,-122.288533,2.0,Pros: Large room with spacious open area. Fridge microwave. Super friendly front desk and housekeeping staff. Very quiet. Cons: Tiny stall shower Seriously! Several bugs a larger than life spider were crawling in the room. The pool pictures are deceiving-it is smack in the middle of the parking lot. No thank you. The free breakfast is actually just packaged goods (providing a toaster over does not make it a hot breakfast). The coffee was...disappointing.
2310,Wine Valley Lodge,Napa,2016-09-05T00:00:00Z,38.283329,-122.288533,3.0,Just a stop over on our way. Convenient to wine country. Short drive to downtown Napa. This is NOT s destination property. One night was plenty. Old 1950's style motor court that is clean.
2311,Wine Valley Lodge,Napa,2016-09-07T00:00:00Z,38.283329,-122.288533,5.0,Had a fabulous time and will definitely return. Perfect location!
2312,Wine Valley Lodge,Napa,2016-10-22T00:00:00Z,38.283329,-122.288533,5.0,"We needed the room for a one night stay, as we were interested in going on the Napa Wine Train, for lunch. Our room was big and the beds were very comfy. We are thinking about going again next year and will definitely book at this hotel. The clerk who checked us in was very friendly at check in time. Even though it was not a big brand hotel, this is where I will be staying from now on!"
2313,Wine Valley Lodge,Napa,2016-05-12T00:00:00Z,38.283329,-122.288533,2.0,"It was okay, nothing special. The room was very small, and very noisy from the next rooms. The breakfast area also felt crowded. High price for such a small room in an ordinary hotel in a less than okay neighborhood."
2314,Wine Valley Lodge,Napa,2016-10-12T00:00:00Z,38.283329,-122.288533,5.0,"Very nice room, all the comforts of home."
2315,Wine Valley Lodge,Napa,2016-07-27T00:00:00Z,38.283329,-122.288533,4.0,"This is an older hotel that is neat, clean, and a really good value for the price. We enjoyed our stay, and would definitely stay there again."
2316,Wine Valley Lodge,Napa,2016-07-21T00:00:00Z,38.283329,-122.288533,2.0,The hotel is very outdated. The room had a musty smell to it. Stains were on carpet shower They definitely need a make over. Judy is the one who checked us in. She was very helpful and gave us many ideas where to go. This was the best part of the stay.
2317,Wine Valley Lodge,Napa,2016-09-02T00:00:00Z,38.283329,-122.288533,4.0,"The hotel was great. It was clean, the breakfast was nice and the staff was friendly and accommodating. I would definitely stay there again. We really just needed a place to sleep because most if the time we were out and about. The bed was very comfortable so I would say the Wine Valley Lodge served it's purpose perfectly."
2318,Wine Valley Lodge,Napa,2016-05-14T00:00:00Z,38.283329,-122.288533,3.0,"It was basic housing, clean, convenient."
2319,Wine Valley Lodge,Napa,2016-07-21T00:00:00Z,38.283329,-122.288533,5.0,"The hotel is older but very well maintained. The room was large and clean. It only had a shower, but that's all I needed. WiFi had a good, fast Internet connection and it was easy to connect. The hotel has satellite TV with enough channels to keep you entertained. The person who checked me in was helpful with giving advice on where to go for food and attractions. The hotel has a breakfast in the morning. The breakfast consists of drinks (coffee, orange juice, milk, etc) and danish, cereals, etc. There are no waffles. All in all there is good value here."

It was a little noisy and the bed was firm for me, but I like a softer bed. Friendly staff and good location to get on the main highways. Definitely would choose it again."
2326,Wine Valley Lodge,Napa,2016-10-04T00:00:00Z,38.283329,-122.288533,4.0,Great little hotel in the heart of wine country. Staff was very helpful with all questions. Made great suggestions.

2329,Wine Valley Lodge,Napa,2016-09-09T00:00:00Z,38.283329,-122.288533,3.0,"It was pretty comfortable, but the walls are very thin and the maids cleaning at 7:30am made a very loud racket, talking loudly and vacuuming. It was impossible to sleep past 7:30am."
2330,Wine Valley Lodge,Napa,2016-07-18T00:00:00Z,38.283329,-122.288533,4.0,"Nothing spectacular but price is right. Continental breakfast is not fancy but it has variety of bread, juice, etc. I think I got what I expected."

2332,Wine Valley Lodge,Napa,2016-05-21T00:00:00Z,38.283329,-122.288533,4.0,"IT WAS EVERYTHING A MOTEL SHOULD BE: REASONABLY PRICED, CLEAN, COMFORTABLE AND QUIET. A BREAKFAST ROOM WITH FRUIT, COFFEE, TEA, BREAKFAST SANDWICHES, YOGURT AND PASTRIES. NICE TOILETRIES. IT'S AN OLD MOTEL, NOT THE LATEST DECOR BUT FOR THE AMENITIES YOU DO GET, YOU CAN'T BEAT IT."
2333,Wine Valley Lodge,Napa,2016-05-08T00:00:00Z,38.283329,-122.288533,5.0,All good except breakfast. Would have like to see some boiled eggs. No protein. Ate elsewhere.

Thank goodness I always carry soap and shampoo in my kit. Very dated even though advertised as remodeled, room looked clean but felt dirty. Didn't seem pleased I booked through hotel.com"

Located off of I25 on the northern outskirts of Cheyenne, across the street from railroad tracks and warehouses. Several noisy trains went by during the evening, although they didn't wake me during the night. Several other, newer hotels in the immediate area, but not many places to eat or get gas."

Could use some work (cracked ceiling, burnt sheets in non smoking room, rusty gross tub, paper thin walls, some of the lights didn't work). Would not recommend unless you really, really, really, need to save money."
2338,Americas Best Value Inn,Cheyenne,2016-04-12T00:00:00Z,41.11915,-104.84949,4.0,It was nice. The potholes turning into the motel were awful.

2343,Americas Best Value Inn,Cheyenne,2016-07-17T00:00:00Z,41.11915,-104.84949,4.0,"Surprisingly comfortable stay. Just stopped in for the night while traveling across country. Pool for the kids to swim in and burn off some energy was small, but it existed and did its job. Breakfast was good. I'd stay again if I was passing through."
2344,Americas Best Value Inn,Cheyenne,2016-06-24T00:00:00Z,41.11915,-104.84949,3.0,We stayed there twice during our round trip. It was great that there were enough beds for a family of six. That rarely happens. The pool was tiny and the breakfast was lacking. But obviously it was alright because we went back on the way home.
2345,Americas Best Value Inn,Cheyenne,2016-07-02T00:00:00Z,41.11915,-104.84949,3.0,The only thing the room needed is new pillows. Good location. We just stayed 1 night.

2351,Americas Best Value Inn,Cheyenne,2016-08-01T00:00:00Z,41.11915,-104.84949,4.0,"We chose this place on the price and just because we needed a stopover on a long road trip. Was surprisingly awesome so we chose to stay here on the way back as well! Its not the most fancy or newly refurnished but the beds were clean, and super comfy, the rooms were spacious and the service was super friendly and helpful. The hot tub was kinda small, but just hot enough and nice and deep so super relaxing. The pool is also really nice, clean and welcoming. Highly recommended, pet and family friendly!"
2352,Americas Best Value Inn,Cheyenne,2016-07-04T00:00:00Z,41.11915,-104.84949,3.0,"The hotel is old. We got in late but I needed to shower and the tub was SUPER loud. Every time I moved around, it cracked and creaked. Not to mention that the shower head was sticking out of a big hole on the wall. It was fine for a night but this wouldn't be my first choice hotel. Although, for the price, I guess I can't really complain. The neighborhood was okay. I don't think there was much to do around but we were just there to sleep and hit the road."
2353,Americas Best Value Inn,Cheyenne,2016-03-09T00:00:00Z,41.11915,-104.84949,4.0,"clean, comfortable. Great desk clerk, very polite and accomodating. No problem with train noise, didn't even hear them. Room heater was a little noisy, but didn't interfere with my sleep. Great value, would stay there again."
2354,Americas Best Value Inn,Cheyenne,2016-05-21T00:00:00Z,41.11915,-104.84949,4.0,Good pricing ... Nice pool
2355,Americas Best Value Inn,Cheyenne,2016-08-24T00:00:00Z,41.11915,-104.84949,3.0,We got registered OK but the room shook the whole night as if a train was going by and the front desk had no explanation. Got no sleep which made the next day of driving difficult.
2356,Americas Best Value Inn,Cheyenne,2016-07-17T00:00:00Z,41.11915,-104.84949,4.0,Pasing through moving from CA to MI. They had parking for a 50ft long vehicle (UHaul plus trailer). The parking location wasn't great but they had security cameras on it and we were only there a few hours - in late and out early. There was a mistake in check in and we initially got a room already occupied. Mgmt was very apologetic and rebooked us to a different room right away (and checked to make sure no one was already there.) :)
2357,Americas Best Value Inn,Cheyenne,2016-07-14T00:00:00Z,41.11915,-104.84949,2.0,"Our room was a 'recently' converted from a smoking room. The only 'conversion' was the sign on the door as non smoking. We had to use our own clothes as pillows due to the smell of the room pillows. The sheets were clean, but the blanket between also smelled. The front desk had no other room to place us or spray to mask the smell. we only stayed because it was paid for. It was the front desk agent that explained the stench."
2358,Americas Best Value Inn,Cheyenne,2016-07-16T00:00:00Z,41.11915,-104.84949,2.0,"Booked this hotel while traveling cross country. It was ok, I wouldnt book agsin. The bathtub squeeked and sounded like it wasnt installed correctly. No hairdryer, towels were small and well worn. Mustly smell in hall and flat pillows."
2359,Americas Best Value Inn,Cheyenne,2016-07-08T00:00:00Z,41.11915,-104.84949,1.0,"I don't really like to complain, but our stay here was terrible. When we walked in the lobby, it didn't look too bad, and we could tell it had been recently updated a bit. When we got in the room, and were setting down our things, I noticed a hair on the bed. I don't really tolerate hair in a clean hotel room, but I threw it away and let it go. When I was helping my daughter wash her hands soon after, the soap dispenser on the wall fell, and then I could tell the bathroom counter and sink were not cleaned, and there was more hair in the sink. The kids were excited to swim, so we ignored this mess and went to the pool. The pool was fine, but the hot tub was very murky. After swimming, we went back to the room and when I pulled the covers down in the bed, there were 2 more hairs. It was late, and we were tired, so I cleaned them up. In the morning, when I opened the shower curtain to take a shower, there was hair hanging from the shower faucet, and then from the towels! I couldn't handle anymore grossness, and we packed up and left. No one in my family got ready that morning, and there was no one one at the front desk to talk to. We skipped breakfast, because we were leary of how anything was really cleaned. I am extremely disappointed in this stay, as hair everywhere is not OK, not excusable. We will not be staying here, or probably any America's Best's, again."

2369,Americas Best Value Inn,Cheyenne,2016-08-04T00:00:00Z,41.11915,-104.84949,2.0,It's not modern. The couch was broke. Musty smell. Just not worth the money in my opinion.
2370,Americas Best Value Inn,Cheyenne,2016-06-04T00:00:00Z,41.11915,-104.84949,3.0,Our stay was pleasant. The Staff was helpful. Motel was clean but facilities were older. Bathrooms were old style but clean. Breakfast was above a continental. It was fine for one night. Convenient to the highway.

2374,Americas Best Value Inn,Cheyenne,2016-07-16T00:00:00Z,41.11915,-104.84949,1.0,After a 15 hour drive with my 1 year old son I was ready to just sleep. We walk in the room and right when you walk in it smells like marijuana and cigarettes. I was instantly disgusted. There were burn marks on the sink and an ash tray in a non smoking room. I go down to the lobby and ask for lysol or something and I spray it in the room still doesn't help. I go back to take lysol and I tell them I'm not paying for this room. It smells horendous. They tell me they'really sorry and will give me 10 discount and at first that's all they could do and I told him the only reason I'm still staying here is because we drove 15-16 hours and we're all exhausted. So he gives us a queen room and a roll-away bed. I go to the bathroom and have to go to the bathroom with the door open because THE LIGHT WOULDN'T TURN ON! The food was alright. Pretty basic. Then when we checked out we didn't even get the 10 discount!!!! I'm appalled by this place and it shouldn't be called America's best it should be called American horror.
2375,Americas Best Value Inn,Cheyenne,2016-06-11T00:00:00Z,41.11915,-104.84949,3.0,The hotel is newly remodeled but done cheaply. It looked clean until you started looking too closely. My sheets were no longer white (white being there original color) and there were holes in the fitted sheet. The hotel staff was very nice but definitely understaffed.

The room and the hallway had a really funky smell that made us gag a bit. Not sure what that was! The room also seemed to be tilted a bit and lacked a bit on cleanliness. The AC didn't work and we had to sleep with the window open. Situated between the freeway and train tracks, made for a noisy night. Friendly staff was the only positive."

Not really worth the 100 we paid for one night. Have stayed in much nicer spots for the same price. It was clean and serviceable, staff was great."

2395,Americas Best Value Inn,Cheyenne,2016-08-07T00:00:00Z,41.11915,-104.84949,1.0,this hotel gave my family room for 6 away and told me that hotels.com canceled it. so I had had to 2 rent rooms for almost twice the money. the rooms smelled like a pet toilet. it was the worst hotel I've stayed in. also something not in the fine print the train goes by every half an hour all night long.
2396,Americas Best Value Inn,Cheyenne,2016-08-13T00:00:00Z,41.11915,-104.84949,3.0,It's a bargain hotel for a reason. The free breakfast had a pathetic selection and was cold so we ate out anyway. The room was clean. The beds were comfy. Flat plastic pillows. The AC is either freezing or roasting. No elevator. Stayed 5 nights our key cards stopped working at least twice. only have us new towels once and that was the day after checking in. Staff was helpful with the key card problem
2397,Americas Best Value Inn,Cheyenne,2016-08-06T00:00:00Z,41.11915,-104.84949,5.0,Enjoyed our stay very much. Very restful. Would like to see items like bagels for your continental breakfast.

Went to town for dinner... town was a dive, luckily found an Outback, next to Home Depot, behind the motel. Only decent place we saw to eat. Staff was courteous and eager to please. Offered a continental breakfast but would prefer some sealed food for those of us afraid of continental breakfasts..."

2404,Americas Best Value Inn,Cheyenne,2016-07-28T00:00:00Z,41.11915,-104.84949,4.0,"We needed a place to stay for one night. We were worried when we saw the run down location but the inside was very pleasant. The staff were very nice and the rooms were fine. nice furnishings and bedding.I read a lot of reviews that mentioned the close proximity to the interstate and train tracks, and whileven you could hear them both, it was. otherwise as bad as some people described"
2405,Americas Best Value Inn,Cheyenne,2016-06-02T00:00:00Z,41.11915,-104.84949,4.0,"We checked in late as planned. when we went to our room, we found someone already in the room we were assigned to. There were no deadbolts or safety locks on the doors, so we were able to just walk in. They did give us another room,and went along to make sure the new room was an empty room."
2406,Americas Best Value Inn,Cheyenne,2016-05-29T00:00:00Z,41.11915,-104.84949,4.0,"Very good, reserved our room at 9:00 pm and they got us in a room when we got there at 11:00 pm"

2408,Americas Best Value Inn,Cheyenne,2016-08-21T00:00:00Z,41.11915,-104.84949,3.0,This hotel was nice but next to the train tracks so you heard trains all night long. You might want to ask for a room away from the tracks. There is a lot of interstate construction so some exits are closed and you had to drive around town to make connections. There won't always be construction so don't let that keep you from staying here. There is an Outback Restaurant two doors down so food is available in the area. The WY State Capitol building is just 3 miles from the hotel and currently under renovation as well but the downtown area is very easy to walk and there are a lot of little shops and restaurants to spend time in. The management staff was very helpful and full of information about the area. It was nice to talk to someone who knew so much about the local area and was so friendly. It makes you feel like your not so far from home when you encounter such a happy staff.
2409,Americas Best Value Inn,Cheyenne,2016-10-07T00:00:00Z,41.11915,-104.84949,2.0,OK but don't think I would stay there again.
2410,Americas Best Value Inn,Cheyenne,2016-07-16T00:00:00Z,41.11915,-104.84949,5.0,"What a great stay for a small price. The room was super spacious, very clean, had a fridge, microwave, coffee maker, ironing board, iron. The beds were extremely comfortable, bathroom was wonderful and huge! Log cabin feeling you will love. The casino, food and service were wonderful as well."
2411,Americas Best Value Inn,Cheyenne,2016-06-13T00:00:00Z,41.11915,-104.84949,4.0,A good basic motel with all the essential ammenities. Would definitely stay here again
2412,Americas Best Value Inn,Cheyenne,2016-05-15T00:00:00Z,41.11915,-104.84949,3.0,After paying through hotels.com they required a separate deposit on my cc. Room was facing railroad tracks and highway but the worst part was the beds!!! Cheap foam with some kind of rubber bag around them so it crinkled with every movement. One thin sheet and cheap blanket and no comforter!! It's winter outside!!
2413,Americas Best Value Inn,Cheyenne,2016-09-11T00:00:00Z,41.11915,-104.84949,3.0,"Room was fine but needs updating. You can tell they've tried to spruce it up some, but it needs things like more outlets and some USB plugs. Employees were not very friendly at all and the breakfast was pretty boring. The bed was pretty comfy. Nice TV."
2414,Americas Best Value Inn,Cheyenne,2016-07-18T00:00:00Z,41.11915,-104.84949,3.0,The bathroom sink was loose and bath door handle slide off

2416,Americas Best Value Inn,Cheyenne,2016-08-01T00:00:00Z,41.11915,-104.84949,3.0,"The only thing in this room that was remodeled is the flat screen tv. The shower had no water pressure, the bathroom fan was very loud. The bed was sort of comportable. The bathroom sink was low to the ground and the faucet was spitting water everywhere."
2417,Americas Best Value Inn,Cheyenne,2016-08-10T00:00:00Z,41.11915,-104.84949,1.0,"The guest service was very rude at check-in, and then kicked all the guests out of the pool just because he can. The hallway on the second floor stunk of smoke and made our eyes tear up. Also our room A/C could not keep the room properly conditioned. The shower was not cleaned either."
2418,Americas Best Value Inn,Cheyenne,2016-10-08T00:00:00Z,41.11915,-104.84949,1.0,This hotel was awful.
2419,Americas Best Value Inn,Cheyenne,2016-08-14T00:00:00Z,41.11915,-104.84949,5.0,"Main issue with this room: You can only connect one wi-fi device at one time. When you have several people with phones, iPads and a laptop, this was a challenge. Otherwise, enjoyed my stay."
2420,Americas Best Value Inn,Cheyenne,2016-08-31T00:00:00Z,41.11915,-104.84949,5.0,It was very impressive to stay in a budget priced hotel that has such quality features.
2421,Americas Best Value Inn,Cheyenne,2016-08-14T00:00:00Z,41.11915,-104.84949,5.0,I was glad to soak in the hot tub. I had to make many phone calls in the morning before I could get on the road. They were patient for my check out time after explaining that a truck had taken my side mirror off of the Uhaul that I was driving and needed to get it replaced.
2422,Americas Best Value Inn,Cheyenne,2016-02-18T00:00:00Z,41.11915,-104.84949,5.0,a good value
2423,Americas Best Value Inn,Cheyenne,2016-03-01T00:00:00Z,41.11915,-104.84949,4.0,"Staff was very nice and helpful. Breakfast was okay. I'm GF so I just had yogurt and a banana but they had some good options. Rooms have been partially remodeled. New beds, bed linens and furniture (including tv). The bed was EXTREMELY comfortable. Bathrooms are still old fixtures but were clean. No blow dryers in rooms ladies. Only soap and shampoo dispensers, no individual bottles. Bottom line, for about 60 it was a good value. You're not getting nicer ammenities but your not paying for them either. If you need a quick overnight stay, it's a good option."
2424,Americas Best Value Inn,Cheyenne,2016-04-20T00:00:00Z,41.11915,-104.84949,1.0,This place was disgusting with a nasty bathroom and stained sheets. I did not stay at this location and left immediately after seeing the room. When I try to get my refund from Expedia the hotel manager tried to tell them I stay there. I did not and will not recommend it to anyone. Don't book this hotel.
2425,Americas Best Value Inn,Cheyenne,2016-09-20T00:00:00Z,41.11915,-104.84949,5.0,"I looked at over 15 different motels in Cheyene, Kimball and Sidney looking for a good motel. This was a home rune hit. It had ok reviews and a reasonable price. When we arrived I was surprised how clean and nice it really was. We had stayed at another American Best a week earlier which was a 3 so this was a great surprise. Staff was polite and professional. I will stay here again"
2426,Americas Best Value Inn,Cheyenne,2016-10-09T00:00:00Z,41.11915,-104.84949,3.0,"Good service and great breakfast. Area is not appealing, but it seemed safe."

2430,Americas Best Value Inn,Cheyenne,2016-08-26T00:00:00Z,41.11915,-104.84949,3.0,"The bed was comfortable and the room was clean, however, if you're a light sleeper, bring earplugs! You can hear the slamming doors and people talking out in the hall."
2431,Americas Best Value Inn,Cheyenne,2016-02-13T00:00:00Z,41.11915,-104.84949,3.0,Was disappointing that the times of checkout and pool times were wrong on the website. Hot tub wasn't very hot. No coffee pot in the room. Other than that it was ok.
2432,Americas Best Value Inn,Cheyenne,2016-08-28T00:00:00Z,41.11915,-104.84949,2.0,"Tv remote didn't work, got a second floor room but no elevator, had to carry luggage up two flutes of stairs. Not impressed."
2433,Americas Best Value Inn,Cheyenne,2016-02-25T00:00:00Z,41.11915,-104.84949,3.0,The staff is excellent but they could not get the noisy and running children to quiet down after four hrs and multiple requests to be quiet and stop running and making excessive noise.
2434,Americas Best Value Inn,Cheyenne,2016-04-01T00:00:00Z,41.11915,-104.84949,3.0,"Quick stop on my way thru. Helpful, friendly desk staff for a late check in and check out. Hotel is a little tired, but serviceable for a quick rest stop."
2435,Americas Best Value Inn,Cheyenne,2016-03-27T00:00:00Z,41.11915,-104.84949,4.0,Looks can be deceiving. Doesn't look that great pulling up but it's pretty descent on the inside. Very nice pool. Clean room and bathroom. Nice staff. Even though recently updated it still looks a little dated.
2436,Americas Best Value Inn,Cheyenne,2016-08-06T00:00:00Z,41.11915,-104.84949,5.0,"I actually stayed at this same hotel at this same time last year. They have done a lot to improve it since then and I thoroughly enjoyed my stay this time. It wasn't horrible last time but given a year's time, I could see the improvements they have made. The beds are VERY comfortable and the WiFi is good. Looks like they've done painting, etc. as well. Staff is still friendly and welcoming and efficient. Really enjoyed the stay!"
2437,Americas Best Value Inn,Cheyenne,2016-09-19T00:00:00Z,41.11915,-104.84949,4.0,Average hotel offering a good nights sleep.
2438,Americas Best Value Inn,Cheyenne,2016-10-30T00:00:00Z,41.11915,-104.84949,3.0,"The towels are really rough, the pool/spa had way to much chlorine. Marie was wonderful at the front desk! There was another lady who was VERY unprofessional, rude and stood talking on a personal phone call while I waited to be check out. I can't remember her name or I'd pass it forward. The breakfast was puke. The juices tasted partially fermented and the coffee burnt....we stayed there 3 days and it was like this every morning. I will never stay here again"
2439,Americas Best Value Inn,Cheyenne,2016-08-05T00:00:00Z,41.11915,-104.84949,2.0,"From the moment we pulled into the hotel, I knew it was not going to be a pleasant stay. The man who checked us in was not friendly at all, didn't greet us and acted like we were interrupting his day by being there. Our room was listed as recently remodeled but looked like it hadn't been updated since 1990. Internet didn't work and when I asked if there was something that could be done, the girl at the desk said no, they were having issues and WiFi was out, no apology, no explanation or compensation for the inconvenience. Location of hotel was terrible, very noisy and the outside door was broken so it was a major pain to get in and out of hotel (and with a dog, this made things very difficult to take him out). I would never stay here again, do yourself a favor and book another hotel"

The shower leaked and didn't have a plunger for baths. The bed was so uncomfortable that sleep was next to impossible. The staff was fairly friendly, though. I won't be staying here again."
2441,Americas Best Value Inn,Cheyenne,2016-08-26T00:00:00Z,41.11915,-104.84949,3.0,"Hotel was a basic room, good for a one-night stopover on a trip. It could use some refreshing - its getting kind of tired and run down."
2442,Americas Best Value Inn,Cheyenne,2016-10-26T00:00:00Z,41.11915,-104.84949,4.0,Economical and convenient for overnight stay on our way.

2444,Americas Best Value Inn,Cheyenne,2016-02-23T00:00:00Z,41.11915,-104.84949,2.0,No elevator - be in shape.. No luggage carts - pack light. South room face railroad tracks - light sleepers take note. Limited places to plug in your laptop - bring an extension cord.

2446,Americas Best Value Inn,Cheyenne,2016-10-27T00:00:00Z,41.11915,-104.84949,3.0,"Really decent ABVI! I've had a mix of experiences across the country with this chain, and this location is somewhere above the median. Really clean, affordable, easy to access, well staffed, quiet, wifi was decent (had some trouble moments mid-evening when everyone around me was on it), and service dog friendly."

Rooms only a little smaller, but almost half the price. Room was perfectly fine. Halls smelled a little funny, as in many hotels, but room was fine. I was in the Little America rooms and was happy we weren't staying there. Even though that's more high quality, supposedly, the value for my money was far higher at this place."
2449,Americas Best Value Inn,Cheyenne,2016-08-15T00:00:00Z,41.11915,-104.84949,2.0,"WiFi could not even download an audio book overnight that normally takes minutes. Not sure what it looked like before renovation. The day desk staff was busy on his cell phone so we checked ourselves out. The bathroom smelled like sewer but the tub enclosure was clean. There was a 1/4 gap around the door letting in most sound from the hall. Finally, it was twice the price it was worth."

2452,Americas Best Value Inn,Cheyenne,2016-07-24T00:00:00Z,41.11915,-104.84949,3.0,"Not the nicest motel in the world, but it was clean. Towels were pretty scratchy. Breakfast came with biscuits and gravy but no eggs. Shampoo, conditioner, soap and lotion are in wall pump dispensers... so good for the environment but really cheap product inside. It was a decent stop over on our way out west."

2704,Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Las Vegas,2016-05-27T00:00:00Z,36.171617,-115.146375,4.0,Went for Punk Rock Bowling. Right in front of the Fremont Experience. Pretty cool. Parking is free once you check in and they'll reimburse the money you used to enter the first time. Bathroom had no window which was weird but got used to it. The best part was live bands playing at the pool. Freakin Angelic upstarts played for free. Dope
2705,Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Las Vegas,2016-07-17T00:00:00Z,36.171617,-115.146375,4.0,The hotel room was nice and clean including the bathroom.
2706,Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Las Vegas,2016-06-29T00:00:00Z,36.171617,-115.146375,4.0,great bang for the buck.
2707,Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Las Vegas,2016-09-22T00:00:00Z,36.171617,-115.146375,3.0,"Parking lot terrible and dirty. Pool closed due to high winds, no notice to guests, and no notice if other hotels pools availability."
2708,Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Las Vegas,2016-07-02T00:00:00Z,36.171617,-115.146375,3.0,I can't be too hard on this hotel because I had an idea of what I was getting into. It looks like it's stuck in the 70's. You can see where some remodeling has been done and is continuing to be done - but keeping up appearances doesn't seem to be urgent. The pool is okay (good for wading) but will deteriorate over time. It's overrun with children and likely local guests. The hallways also had a not so fresh scent. My room was very dingy and lacked warmth and much comfort. As someone who enjoys spending time in the hotel room on vacation it was very bleh! Didn't try the dining options - I recommend eating at Main Street Station for the buffet. Casino floor is very smoky. Obviously right at the Fremont experience if that is what you are looking for. Will likely never stay here again.
2709,Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Las Vegas,2016-07-19T00:00:00Z,36.171617,-115.146375,4.0,"Even though it's right there across the street from the Fremont Experience with all that noise and energy, the room was quiet and nice.(Be aware! During special times like around New Year's, where bands are playing all the time, it might be loud....that was my experience at the D, the Grand, and another hotel. I cannot guarantee it won't be loud here too I just don't know.) Anyway, no complaints. at all."

2712,Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Las Vegas,2016-07-10T00:00:00Z,36.171617,-115.146375,4.0,"We can hear noises off and on created by the wind,We're on the 15th floor. Have to place towel to seal the door to prevent the wind escaping inside and creates annoyinunog loud noise. It works! For the price it's affordable, reasonable and saved lots of money. Free valet parking, and the attendants are helpful and courteous."

There was no breakfast as indictated, we had to find a restaurant. The building was renovated but there was a wrapper stuck to the window behind the currents overlooking the Fremont Experience block. The north wing takes a different elevator than the south wing. The parking garage has its own elevator that you must use which is on the opposite end of the plaza from where the elevators are you must use to get to your rooms. The kiosk to check in for yiur flights was down, but the check in people helped in printing out our tickets in their office. Everyone was polite and professional. Plenty of gambling and place to eat nearby. It is located 25 minutes from the airport."

Hotel is in ok shape for its age, but they charge you 10 to park even if you are a guest. Most other hotels in the area will validate/comp parking for hotel guest."

2722,Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Las Vegas,2016-06-24T00:00:00Z,36.171617,-115.146375,1.0,Didnt like our stay at all. Took forever to get a room. Then took forever for the elevators because only 2 were working. Got in the room it's very outdated. The fridge is old and dented. The toilet had urine on the seat. The bed said queen size but seemed like full.
2723,Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Las Vegas,2016-06-13T00:00:00Z,36.171617,-115.146375,2.0,"The bathroom had hair on the floor when we got there and throughout our stay. The service was poor long lines with never a second associate to help check in or out, though people were behind the counter. Their pool was being renovated and a nearby hotel was allowing guests to swim there, but that was never told to us. We heard it told to someone else while we were waiting to check out. You really get what you pay for with this one."

Would have been nice to have small refrig. and microwave paid extra for small refrig. (brought up right away). Towels and wash cloths were limited, but soon as I called for extra, housekeeping came up quickly and delivered. The hotel was not posh, and a bit old, but the service was great, the room was clean and smoke free. The Greyhound bus station is literally next door and appeared derelict free. Parking became limited on Saturday night. All-in-all, I'd go back."
2728,Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Las Vegas,2016-10-22T00:00:00Z,36.171617,-115.146375,3.0,"Parking is a joke. Valet is at the other end of the casino from registration. We were handed ear plugs at check-in, due to all night noise from Freemont Street. Didn't use them, but it was unusual."
2729,Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Las Vegas,2016-06-20T00:00:00Z,36.171617,-115.146375,2.0,"Wait times to check in were in excess of 40 minute on a Monday night around 10pm. Elevator took well over 10minutes to come to ground level and even longer to go to level 4. Credit card was hacked at front desk on the swipe because they do not use the newer chip technology. Received a call from chase and asked if i made several purchases the next morning and that is how i discovered the breech. Please start using the chip, such a stronger platform and helps prevent things like this. I'm not upset with the hotel for the hack, however measures should be taken to protect your customers."

The hotel itself was fine, but Fremont is filthy. I was wearing flip flops and ended up throwing them away because they were so dirty. If you are looking for a weekend of partying on a budget then this is the place to go."
2731,Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Las Vegas,2016-07-13T00:00:00Z,36.171617,-115.146375,5.0,"Excellent!!! I stayed here the first night of a three day stay in Vegas. I did to get the Fremont experience. The hotel was clean, staff was friendly and the pool party was fun. The cocktail waitress was particularly fun and accommodating.

My reservation dates or scheduled wrong by the hotel and we're one day short. The room did not have a refrigerator or microwave and the beds are uncomfortable. Television service was not good.

There was no other path from the parking to the lobby but still we were approached 3 times by security to make our kids not look at the machines. Very rude! Make a casino clear path to the lobby and we will be glad to avoid looking at the machines and breathing the stinky smell of cigarettes! The street across the hotel made a very loud noise all night even from the 22 floor."

They said they working on the water so a lot of guests didn't have hot water, they said about another hour hot water should be back on. The leaking cooler, they didn't get back to us because, they were going to send someone up to take a look at it, but my husband and son were still sleeping. This is like 8am. So they said let us know when. We left to meet our Realtor. So we didn't let them know and by the time we got back. We were too tired from everything. But at least they could've called our room and asked if we still needed the cooler checked. The had our numbers also. I mean would think that they would note it down on the the computer. No fridge in the room, if you want one, it's 20 a day. No microwave. No view of Las Vegas. The only is concrete walls. If you want a view of Las Vegas. 20 extra. We had to pay 10 to park in the garage, the first time. Later I asked the front desk if we had to pay but, they reimburse us. Later I asked if we had to pay every time we parked in the garage. He said No, just use our room card to go in and out."

Arriving back at my room at the end of a festive night, I wasn't sure why it wasn't as cool as I thought my room could or should be--it wasn't until I couldn't sleep that I knew for sure there was a problem. When I went to the front desk first thing in the morning, I was told, Sorry, but since you booked through a 3rd party there's not much we can do. Well--the 3rd party didn't assign me that room with the faulty AC unit (one that looked like it had not been cleaned or maintained in years). The Plaza did that. After getting to my new room, and comparing the AC units--it was like I was given the faulty room specifically because I booked through a 3rd party, that way if I complained all they had to say was, Sorry, but since you booked through a 3rd party there's not much we can do. Yeah. I won't be staying there again."

After reading a prior review from a Lady I was a little leary of staying here because of deposit drama. But they do take a 50 deposit upon check-in and it was immediately credited upon check-out. They did put us on the back side of the hotel. Did hear a couple of trains during the night, ac was a little loud but really not a bad place. Was clean comfortable. Great location, walk out the lobby, cross the street and you are on Fremont Street."

2777,Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Las Vegas,2016-08-03T00:00:00Z,36.171617,-115.146375,3.0,"This place was economical but they have really poor customer service during the check out. For those wanting an express check out - you cant easily get a receipt for business services because the hotel staff takes a long time with check in process with little thought to check out process. They need two lines. People need receipts, and cant wait 30 minutes to check out. Consider putting receipt under doors the night before check out."

2784,Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Las Vegas,2016-06-25T00:00:00Z,36.171617,-115.146375,1.0,The room was okay for the price. I would not stay there again. The hotel is being renovated and I was in a newly renovated room. If you don't mind the basics and care more about the price then this might work for you. The room itself was half renovated--one of the chairs was old and gross but the room is pretty basic. It's like a fancy Motel 6. My friend was on a budget otherwise I definitely would not have stayed here. The pool was closed--was only open to some people but the guy who worked there wouldn't even let me look through the glass door at the pool. He was rude. I asked if I could look through the glass door to check out their new pool and he said no the pool was closed--it was five minutes to 7 and they close at 7. Yikes. The fire alarm went off when we were there. One of the staff told us we could ignore it. My friend was concerned so we went to the front desk to find out. No one would talk to us and we had to wait to get someone's attention. It took a long time before we found out it was a false alarm and eventually they gave an all clear. BTW the check in line was ridiculously long and only one person was at the counter. They seem sad to work there.

2787,Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Las Vegas,2016-10-04T00:00:00Z,36.171617,-115.146375,2.0,Put on your walking shoes because this place does NOT have parking close to the hotel. The area of town it is in is also not the most desirable. Guess I should have known that for the price. Rooms had been redecorated but weren't modern by any stretch of the imagination. I'd pass on the opportunity to stay here again.
2788,Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Las Vegas,2016-07-16T00:00:00Z,36.171617,-115.146375,3.0,EVERYTHING WAS OK EXCEPT FOR THAT UPON CHECKING IN I WAS CHARGED MORE THAN I WAS QUOTED AND THE FRONT DESK DID NOT TELL ME HOW MUCH THEY WERE CHARGING MY CARD UNTIL AFTER THEY PROCESSED 2 TRANSACTIONS...

I loved the size of the room as well, the only things i didn't like was the bad smell at the bottom of the elevator. It smelled like BO. Another thing is when checking out to get an elevator takes like 30 mins to an hour and the stairs isn't an option when you're on the 12th floor. Everything else was good. I didn't like that our bed sheets had some dirty spots on them."
2801,Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Las Vegas,2016-07-14T00:00:00Z,36.171617,-115.146375,5.0,"Liked the convenience of Fremont Street. Did not like the access to the parking garage, when staying in the North Tower. Liked the convenience of all the restaurants. Didn't like that the pool was only open until 7pm. The hotel staff was friendly. Didn't like having to pay the resort fees in addition to the room price. It should be included in the negotiated rate. The beds were very comfortable. The A/C worked awesome, since it was so hot.....108 in the day/ 98 in the night. Maintenance came quickly for a clogged toilet. Overall it was great, we had fun not worrying about the small stuff."

The housekeepers (i guess you call them) did not clean, fix beds, leave towels, soap or toilet paper. I am unhappy and feel as though i should be compensated for this horrible experience."

There was no coffee or wash cloths in the room. Every time we called the front desk no one answered. On our last day there was no hot water in bathroom and TV had no signal during our stay over the weekend.

2810,Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Las Vegas,2016-10-09T00:00:00Z,36.171617,-115.146375,2.0,There are no amenities at this hotel. No room service. Valet is a city block from registration. Just blah. Fremont street can be heard loud and clear in you room (16th floor) loud and clear until about 1:30am. The other side of the hotel you have trains. Very noisy no matter where you are located.

Hotels.com says they have dry cleaning / laundry service room service-- trust me....they don't. I wouldn't stay here again. The only good thing is it was right there at the Fremont Street Experience, which is what my friend wanted to see."

2820,Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Las Vegas,2016-03-11T00:00:00Z,36.171617,-115.146375,2.0,"If you are unlucky enough to have one of the suite rooms in the tower closest to the Fremont Experience, you will get noisy neighbors who are there to celebrate all night long and sleep during the day. If your neighbors are quiet, you'll get noise from the Fremont Experience Bands playing until the early morning, or the grinding of freight trains on the tracks all night long! If you do stay here, request a room in the other tower, the one that is further away from the Check-In desk and the Fremont Experience. You might actually be able to sleep!"

2828,Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Las Vegas,2016-08-26T00:00:00Z,36.171617,-115.146375,3.0,"When searching for hotels in Vegas, there are LOADS of options. I knew my boyfriend and I were not going to be in the hotel very long, so I didn't expect 5 star, but I didn't want a 1 star dirty Motel 6 either. I chose this hotel because 70 for a deluxe king sounded great. Photos looked great and looked modern. We arrived at the hotel around 10pm, and waited in line for 15 minutes to check in. Upon checking in, the lady at the desk said they had no king beds available, as booked, but only 2 double beds. Fine. When we got in the room... one of the lamps was unplugged, and we shortly discovered the only way to turn the lamp on and off is by plugging/unplugging it. The 2 double beds had 2 small square pillows each... definitely had to double them, and use 2 each. Horrible view, onto a roof with some AC unit type things. windows did not open, however there were handles and some cracked caulk on it."

2839,Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Las Vegas,2016-08-19T00:00:00Z,36.171617,-115.146375,1.0,"Horrible. Do not stay in this hotel! First they didnt bother accommodating us with 1 bed (couple) and instead gave us 2 smaller beds. (We were there during the week and there were many available rooms). The front desk was rude ( I assume they get nasty from dealing with people but all we did was ask a simple question and they were rude about it). The bathtub was clogged, we asked to unclog it and they left a mess without cleaning it up. Dirt all over the tub, and it gets worse. The bathtub still remained clogged after their snaking attempt. The lights in the room are bad, they only had 2 lamps and no ceiling light so room remained with little light. THEY CHARGE A HIDDEN FEE! We stayed for 3 nights and we got charged 82 in extra fees without warning. We have stayed in many hotels before and they usually warn us when there are parking fees or any fees. This hotel did not mention any extra fees. The elevator was disgusting, someone urinated all over the inside of elevator."

Hotel itself thought feels tired and room was somewhat dated with old blinds, dingy shower, date lamps and the toilet seat was 100 broken off. Called first day to get it fixed - next day, never done. Stayed 4 nights. A so so value for the money. Great view from the 21st floor. Casino was also tired. Bed was comfy. Overall I would probably not stay here again. Not that bad, but not great either."

2844,Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Las Vegas,2016-06-24T00:00:00Z,36.171617,-115.146375,2.0,"I was moved to this hotel because of an issue with the reservation and this hotel is overpriced. The location to the old strip is the only plus, the room was horrible, the hotel was dirty and felt very unsafe. Anyone could walk in and around, the room felt dirty and overall I would not recommend this hotel other than in an emergency or budget."
2845,Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Las Vegas,2016-08-02T00:00:00Z,36.171617,-115.146375,4.0,I enjoyed staying at the plaza hotel. The price was great and everyone at the hotel was super friendly.

2847,Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Las Vegas,2016-09-20T00:00:00Z,36.171617,-115.146375,2.0,"Very disappointing. When I checked in, I was informed of a 18.50 daily Resort Fee. Although this included free parking, I was also charged 20/night because I had an oversized vehicle (Van that would not fit into their garage). With Tax, I was charged an additional 81.00 for my 2 day stay. What a rip off."
2848,Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Las Vegas,2016-09-02T00:00:00Z,36.171617,-115.146375,1.0,"There were some issues with the room. No TV guide, no phone directory to the hotel. Air conditioner was loud and not working properly. Could not get cold water, we had to let the water run for a few minutes. When I talked to the front desk. They did not offer a different room. They sent up maintenance to the room and they could not fix the problem."

I made several calls and spoke to house keeping, security and lost and found. Nobody could find my items or really cared that they were missing. I've stayed at many hotels and on occasion, left something behind. I've never had a hotel not find, and return my items. This hotel seemed fine with someone stealing 300 worth of clothes. It seems like it should be simple to get items back, as long as they are turned in my house keeping and tagged with a room number."
2851,Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Las Vegas,2016-07-01T00:00:00Z,36.171617,-115.146375,3.0,"Room was nothing special. No fridge, no microwave, no coffee maker. Very small bathroom and tub looked stained and dirty. Hotel floor was gross. My shoes were black on the bottom after walking to the elevator and into my room. Beds were comfy which was good. Room was very close to pool so there was a lot of music noise. Second day they had a grand opening of the pool with very loud band and fireworks which kept me from getting much sleep."
2852,Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Las Vegas,2016-07-01T00:00:00Z,36.171617,-115.146375,3.0,"Other than the friendly check in clerk, almost every other employee is rude, and if you ask them something, it's like you're bothering them, how could they be this way with the people that make your paycheck When I called housekeeping to request a toothbrush, she laughed and said they don't supply those to the guests. I would expect at least the toothbrush - with the resort fee they shouldn't have a problem stocking this."
2853,Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Las Vegas,2016-10-12T00:00:00Z,36.171617,-115.146375,2.0,About 7am in the morning I purchased a coffee and was drinking it in the lobby when a security person came up and said if I went to sleep I was going to jail. I was amazed!

Clean, and close to everything downtown. Also, had McDonalds and other food places in the hotel. The bathroom was a little bit dark, but otherwise we enjoyed it and would stay there again"

Positives: The location was good, it was easy for me to get a cab whenever I needed one, the room was a good size, when the maid noticed that the bath tub was draining slow, they called for maintenance and they came up right away. Negatives: the beds were a little uncomfortable, the bathroom was too small, the wait for the elevator was long (expected when there is a lot of people)."
2858,Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Las Vegas,2016-08-13T00:00:00Z,36.171617,-115.146375,3.0,"Casino was good and look in good condition. Elevator and walls were ok. The room was nice and big very clean BUT the shower/toilet were clog and water will take forever to come down, we the front desk twice to have somebody coome up and fixed or get a another room but booth times we were xfer to a vm. Overall will stay there again: yes , if the price Still right."

2865,Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Las Vegas,2016-09-14T00:00:00Z,36.171617,-115.146375,2.0,Hotel shows its age. Very dirty and not well maintained. Got what I paid for. Right on Freemont street. So that was good. All the employees were very nice. Free parking.
2866,Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Las Vegas,2016-08-26T00:00:00Z,36.171617,-115.146375,3.0,"We've stayed at the Plaza our last 4 trips, and this was by far the worst experience. The front desk was very robotic like unwelcoming, and rude and when asking for a manager they were no better very uncaring.The website still lists they're poker room unlike any other which we've come to enjoy and is the main reason we frequent the plaza and they no longer have a poker room much less live poker games."
2867,Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Las Vegas,2016-09-14T00:00:00Z,36.171617,-115.146375,3.0,Room was average. The room and hotel smelled of cigarette smoke. The toilet base needed to be fixed. The towel rack was broken. Our room looked over Fremont Street which was fine except the music blared until 2:00 am. The hotel and rooms could use some updating
2868,Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Las Vegas,2016-08-25T00:00:00Z,36.171617,-115.146375,5.0,I love the Plaza.. its my fav place to stay in Downtown Vegas. All the staff are so nice and it's also quiet if you're a sleeper.

My boyfriend and I got to our room to our room and we're impressed right away. The second night we were there though, I wasn't by the window and stepped back only to realize there had been a large sewing needle in the carpet somewhere and it ended up going right through my toe. Housekeeping and the headband of security were great about the whole thing going and accommodated me burn it was still a bummer. Other than that, the Plaza hotel and our stay was great!"
2870,Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Las Vegas,2016-06-20T00:00:00Z,36.171617,-115.146375,3.0,Front desk was VERY UNDERSTAFFED. Waited over an hour just to check in. Wanted to go back to the front desk to ask for a local recommendation but decided that it wouldn't be worth the wait (more long lines) so we just went walking and asked people on the street.
2871,Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Las Vegas,2016-10-05T00:00:00Z,36.171617,-115.146375,5.0,Nice stay for a one nighter. Flew in late.

2874,Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Las Vegas,2016-09-22T00:00:00Z,36.171617,-115.146375,4.0,Our stay was ideal at The Plaza! Close to Fremont Street. Easy Access to Valet. Great folks at the hotel are always very helpful. South Tower is easily accessible.

2876,Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Las Vegas,2016-09-23T00:00:00Z,36.171617,-115.146375,2.0,"I reserved a room with two double beds months in advance for the life is beautiful festival. Check in was a huge mess lines were so ridiculous. My friend and I both each got rooms in at least 3 months and advance and we each got a room with one king bed, rather than two rooms each with two double beds like we asked for. They did not tell us that they gave us different rooms at check in, so we found out once we got to our rooms. I called room service and front desk and all that they said was it was booked up so they couldn't give either of double beds hung up on me. Had to call again to ask for a roll in bed, since I didn't get to ask before because they hung up on me. They only had one and so my friend didn't get one but luckily i did for my room. And the lady on the phone in room service was really rude and short with me. Elevator situation was a disaster, especially after the festival. I think only a couple of them worked and stair access was not really existent unless for emergency exiting. They also refused late checkout saying they were booked the next day even though they messed up my reservation. The new pool was pretty nice and clean and well put together. Though most of the pool is in shade by noon from its own hotel building of the plaza. Cleanliness and location were fine. I'll probably consider a different hotel next time. I've had a way better experience at Golden Nugget in the past, so I'll probably choose to go there instead if I want to stay DT."
2877,Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Las Vegas,2016-09-19T00:00:00Z,36.171617,-115.146375,1.0,It was not very good the room did not reflect the pictures you saw of rooms on the website. There was nothing myself or my wife liked about the room what so ever
2878,Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Las Vegas,2016-07-12T00:00:00Z,36.171617,-115.146375,1.0,"For sure the rooms don't look like as advertised. Bed uncomfortable and the middle of the bed big dent. Service was not at all great, customer service not there at all."
2879,Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Las Vegas,2016-09-28T00:00:00Z,36.171617,-115.146375,3.0,"The hotel is in a good downtown location. The area is always lively and has plenty of places to eat. However, the elevators are pretty old, and may take up to five minutes to provide service. Also, the rooms aren't very sound proof, so the concerts going on outside make for difficult sleep."

2881,Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Las Vegas,2016-10-06T00:00:00Z,36.171617,-115.146375,4.0,"The Plaza has a great location at the end of Fremont Street. The room was clean, updated, and simple. No luxury, and definitely your standard hotel room. The pool area is a decent size, but not fancy like those pool areas at hotels on the strip. There are 15 tennis courts next to it - still not sure why."
2882,Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Las Vegas,2016-09-16T00:00:00Z,36.171617,-115.146375,3.0,We have stayed at the Plaza several times in the past but his time the air conditioner noise was terrible. It rattled so much it would wake me up. My friends had the same complaint about their air conditioner in their room. We did use the pool which was very nice. Can't say I will stay there again.
2883,Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Las Vegas,2016-08-15T00:00:00Z,36.171617,-115.146375,5.0,Not what I expected. Glad we stayed here. Great experience. Very nice hotel.

2886,Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Las Vegas,2016-08-28T00:00:00Z,36.171617,-115.146375,3.0,We needed a place to stay for the night while passing through Las Vegas. We wanted a hotel that was close to I-15 and inexpensive but clean. The Plaza Hotel was inexpensive and relatively clean and quiet but a little musty. It was nice that it was located very close to Freemont Street so we had an opportunity to experience Freemont Street without much effort. The front desk staff were nice and attentive. If we were passing through Las Vegas again and needed a place to crash for the night I would stay at this hotel again.
2887,Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Las Vegas,2016-08-31T00:00:00Z,36.171617,-115.146375,4.0,"Good hotel especially for the price. Great location, just at the end of Freemont St. They do need more pillows for the beds."

The lady that checked us in was a little rude and did not explain how we get to our room. Acting like she just did not want to help us. THe lady that checked us out was so nice and thats when we finally recieved our reciept."

Disappointed with no mini fridge to keep our beverages cold and left over food from spoiling. Remote for TV not working. In room phone not working, could not access front desk for help. Ice machine working only on one floor, which was two floors below my room. Confusing layout--had to walk around the lobby and casino in bathing suit because of pool location. Pool bar open only for a few hours...pool good for relaxing, very clean and calm, not a party pool."
2899,Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Las Vegas,2016-09-27T00:00:00Z,36.171617,-115.146375,4.0,Quiet and clean room. The hotel has an odd fragrance in the air in the hotel.
2900,Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Las Vegas,2016-09-13T00:00:00Z,36.171617,-115.146375,3.0,"The hotel room was decent, cleanliness could have been better, there was a splatter of some sort on the ceiling and running down a door. The chair in the room had a stain on it, as if someone sat on it with their dirty bare bottom. Also most of the towels had stains on them. Another thing, I wish their entire restroom was private. The sink area is separated from the toilet and shower, with no privacy. And the lighting there is very dim. Makes it hard to get ready, makeup wise."
2901,Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Las Vegas,2016-08-19T00:00:00Z,36.171617,-115.146375,4.0,It was very comfortable with a great price/location.

It was a nice, but aging, hotel. It isn't luxurious but the staff are friendly and helpful. The casino is old and limited but we had fun anyway."
2903,Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Las Vegas,2016-06-24T00:00:00Z,36.171617,-115.146375,1.0,"Well, we arrived at the hotel around 10pm, after a long drive and had to wait in line for about 30 min to check in. Some how they only had one person to check every one. For the price we paid, I was expecting a better experience... The only reason I booked that room was because it had a tub/shower however, the tub was dirty, I could not even used it( We had no tv remote control in the room and the hallway stank badly!! The casino was nice, but no one came up to offer us a drink. The restaurant was ok, the food was marginal. The best part was walking around the neighborhood, it is a great location!! We walked back to our room around 2 am and the check in line was still going strong... Checking out next morning was a nightmare, people complaining of various situations and still having to wait in line for awhile, this time at least they had 2 people at the front desk! They never asked how our stay was, and when I mentioned we had no tv remote in the room the guy said oh well, maybe the last guest just took it I don't like to complain and understand sometimes things happens, but come on... One more think, the parking lot is a bit far and if you are planning to bring a lot of things from your car it sUcks!!! I don't think I will ever satay there again!"
2904,Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Las Vegas,2016-09-26T00:00:00Z,36.171617,-115.146375,1.0,Horrible! Dirty halls - piles of trash dirty linens laid in hall all night long. (see pics). Very strict checkout policy - told me if I stayed 5 minutes past 11am I would be billed another 22.

Our biggest complaint was that there was no coffee maker, fridge, or micro in the room. The TV channels were very limited and the cable box did not function very well. On the plus side the Fremont street experience was directly across the street. On the whole the Plaza is fine especially if you like gambling."

2909,Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Las Vegas,2016-07-29T00:00:00Z,36.171617,-115.146375,3.0,"My Fiance and I stayed at the Plaza Hotel in Downtown Vegas and we weren't expecting much from this older hotel. When we arrived there on Friday afternoon they only had ONE bellman and ONE Valet attendant. It was busy with everyone coming in for the weekend and they were clearly overwhelmed. Once the bellman arrived to take our luggage (after a good 25 minutes), we waited in the Check-in line for 30 MINUTES! They only had TWO people working in the counter and the ONE manager that they had was dealing with another guests who was very irritated by the fact that her air conditioner was not working. Upon finally making it to the counter the lady who is helping us coughs on our credit cards and says that she thinks she's getting sick because she has the chills. WHAT THE HECK!! Thanks for your contaminating our stuff you virus on legs! Once we finally got to our room in the 17th floor we immediately washed our hands and face so we wouldn't sick only to find that the bathroom hadn't been restocked with towels! The ice bucket had a wet paper towel already in it..yuck! The poor bellman who was by himself took another 30 minutes to bring us our things. If it wasn't for the fact that housekeeping came fast with extra towels and that UBER was easily accessible, i would be mad!!!"

2911,Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Las Vegas,2016-10-31T00:00:00Z,36.171617,-115.146375,2.0,"Horrible stay, bathroom was so small you practically had to stand in shower to turn around, elevators very slow- took 20 min to get elevator in lobby, extra charges at check out were unexpected, no closet in room, older hotel."
2912,Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Las Vegas,2016-10-21T00:00:00Z,36.171617,-115.146375,3.0,"My stay was ok... I didn't like the fact that I was promised a room with double beds and ended up being given a single,corner,slanted room. Also, they didn't have my reservation when I arrived. I felt as if I was given the bottom of the barrel in room accommodations. I didn't like the fact that their wasn't a shuttle to pick us up or take us back to the airport."
2913,Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Las Vegas,2016-07-31T00:00:00Z,36.171617,-115.146375,3.0,The Hotel itself is located in the original downtown. It is convenient to World Market. The staff are pleasant and the Casino was well looked after. An electrical breaker shorted in the room and was moved at 3am was moved to another room...showed up to the new room...Surprise! Walked in at 3:30 Ooops! Occupied. Went back to front desk. Reassigned to a suite which was appreciated..I was glad I did it alone and did not have family with.
2914,Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Las Vegas,2016-07-29T00:00:00Z,36.171617,-115.146375,2.0,Had a bad experience staying at plaza hotel Las vegas. As I was taking a shower the lights from the restroom went off. I reset the button on the electrical wall receptical turned on the light and it immediately turned off as if there was a short in the electrical system. I called the front desk and explained to the receptionist the issue I was having. She said that she had to email a tech to come in for repairs and when I asked her how long it would take she rudely replied that she didn't know. Due to minimal sunlight into the bathroom I had no other choice but to shower in complete darkness. I was in Vegas for a family reunion so I was gone most of that day and about 3hrs after I left the room I got a call from the front desk to inform me that there was a water leak in my room and that they were moving us to the room next door. What scared me the most was the fact that the water leak might have been causing the light to short out and that there might have been a possibility of getting electrocuted while I was showering. The next two days that I stood there I was uncomfortable showering. I would definitely not recommended this hotel and would not stay there again.

Valet Service and Bell Hop Service were not clearly marked, took 45 minutes to find out we were in the wrong location for those services. Not enough Bell Hops or luggage carts for use."
2917,Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Las Vegas,2016-08-12T00:00:00Z,36.171617,-115.146375,1.0,I have to give this hotel a negative review. The reason why is they would not valet park my Mercedes Sprinter van. So I had to park at there overflow parking lot down the street. I have no problem with parking there UNTIL I find out they charged me 20.00 a day on top of my room cost. The manager said she could do nothing about the parking charges. And just a note they had oversized spots in the valet lot.
2918,Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Las Vegas,2016-08-18T00:00:00Z,36.171617,-115.146375,4.0,"i always enjoy stay there, the only thing i was surprice that i did not have coffee maker or coffee in my room, other than that it was great."

On our way through the casino floor security tool me to the front desk and evicted me from the hotel for prostitution. I have never been so hurt in my life, I had book our rooms a month in advance for 2 nights, I am a certified caregiver in Washington state. I asked TO SPEAK with the manager who did nothing. We were parked on the garage fifth floor and I had to carry all my luggage as I could not walk on the casino floor. They did not refund any of our money or even say they were sorry, I asked them to show me the video of the casino floor and was told they have no audio. I left crying and I will never return and thanks to there rude and unprofessional staff I never even wan to go to Vegas again."

2926,Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Las Vegas,2016-08-29T00:00:00Z,36.171617,-115.146375,4.0,"I stay at this Hotel often as part of my local staycation spots. This time I was a little disappointed. Check in was great as always but when I got to my room it was still occupied and dirty! I went back downstairs to advise the front desk clerk and she was questioning me as if it was my fault the room was dirty and still occupied. She keep telling me the room shows her available and clean and wanted me to go back to the room and wait for housekeeping. I was furious, but didn't explode. I simply told her to get their housekeeping staff in order and to do their job correctly, find me another room or cancel my reservations. She gave me another room. I go back upstairs and that room was clean but had no towles, soap or bathroom tissue. By this time, I'm extremely tired and frustrated. I just called housekeeping and had someone bring the items missing in the room. I will be submitting a formal complaint to the company/hotel directly because that is just unacceptable. I like the hotel and want to continue using them but after this my interest has changed."
2927,Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Las Vegas,2016-09-26T00:00:00Z,36.171617,-115.146375,5.0,"I was here on business, for the most part. Everything was going well, until last night. On my last night I decided to go to bed early, so I took my medication and as soon as it hit me the fire alarm on my floor started going off. I had to go down to the lobby to find out what was happening, and then my key decided not to work. So I had to go back down again, and have security take me back up. I was completely exhausted, and security was on top of it! Thank god for them! I will stay there again, that's for sure, Jeff Rutkin"

The first night I could not fall asleep because of that thing. Also the elevators are really slow for the parking garage. Wish there was a refrigerator too. Other than that it was a good hotel in a good location."
2930,Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Las Vegas,2016-10-15T00:00:00Z,36.171617,-115.146375,3.0,"The Plaza was just your run of the mill hotel. Upon entering the casino area to check in, we were hit with a horrible smell. We had to walk from one end to the other to check in. The smell was everywhere! The ceiling looked as though it could cave at any time. The smell made us all nauseous gave us headaches. The room was clean, the beds okay. The location was great to hit Fremont street. We chose not to eat, gamble, or do anything in the building, but walk to from our room. Pretty sure we won't be staying there again."
2931,Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Las Vegas,2016-09-04T00:00:00Z,36.171617,-115.146375,2.0,We have stayed in downtown Vegas a lot and love to try new hotels when I heard that the plaza had a new pool I decided to give it another try. I had problems with the front desk been rude well this time it was no different I asked for non smoking and it specifically says it there and they stated they had no non smoking rooms available anymore and I had my daughter with me now I know that Vegas is no place for a child but last minute my babysitter cancelled and we had everything arranged to go so we had to. So I tell them and she says that she has only smoking but that they would send someone to deodorize my room I waited an hr no one shows I call the front desk to see what's going on they said she was on her way and again no one shows after half an hour I called again and again until I got tired no one ever showed so I sprayed the place with my own stuff and it smelled better I don't understand why am asked what kind of room I want if am going to be given whatever they want not caring upon my request
2932,Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Las Vegas,2016-10-22T00:00:00Z,36.171617,-115.146375,5.0,Our stay was a quick one. Just one night. We enjoyed all the downtown Vegas had to offer. Our only complaints about the room were that the restroom did not have a vanity mirror. Our other complaint was that our favorite spot downtown no longer existed.

We had a wonderful stay and Plaza exceeded our expectations! Check in was a breeze, and every staff member we encountered was very friendly, some even making small conversation with us. The rooms/hallways/elevator areas were always kept very clean. We only made it to the pool once, but wished we could have spent more time down there! Plenty of chairs to relax in, roulette tables, and a food truck...its a cool little hang out spot! We absolutely would stay here again!"

But then you can rely on the Cleaning Lady, because she can't speak/understand English. All can say is I do not know, go downstairs when you ask her a question. Also the big NO..NO for me is she open my door with her own keycard without asking and that was 9:00 in the morning. Oh I like the lay out of the bathroom but the sink is too high ( square sink on top of the counter) NO FRIDGE / NO MICROWAVE / NO COFFEE MAKER (20.00 per Night if you request one coffee maker they don't have Tea)"

2950,Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Las Vegas,2016-09-14T00:00:00Z,36.171617,-115.146375,4.0,My room was very spacious and clean. The location is great with Fremont St right out your door. The rooftop pool and bar was very nice and bartender and security staff very friendly. The casino itself is lacking and needs updating there is just no life in there compared to other casinos in the area.The Internet seemed to work very well. Overall I would stay here again.
2951,Plaza Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas,Las Vegas,2016-08-25T00:00:00Z,36.171617,-115.146375,1.0,"When I checked in, I was surprised with a 50 deposit that was not in my budget. Then I was given a King room when I requested 2 queens. Got moved to the new room only to find out our keys wouldn't open that door and had to go back down to the desk to resolve that issue. The front desk person had an attitude the whole time. When we finally got into our room, (almost an hour after arriving) and it was dirty. There was hair all over the bathroom floor, sink, and tub. Also, I found dried urine on the floor by the toilet. When I called the front desk to complain, the night manager had an attitude. They sent someone to clean and he didn't know what he was doing. He was rude to me. He picked up the hair, but didn't use any cleaners. I will not be staying at The Plaza again. I DO NOT recommend anyone else stay there either."

My last visit to Hershey left me with a bad taste in my mouth (I wrote a review about that hotel). From the moment I walked in, I was greeted with a hello and a smile. The whole check-in took probably at most, 5 mins (my tired children were thankful for this). We had a 2 double bed room that was updated, clean and had more than what we needed for an overnight stay. The bathroom was updated a clean as well. The linens were clean and the beds were comfy. We were pleased with the complimentary breakfast as well. It offered something for everyone, in my opinion. Fruit, muffins, cereal, danishes, eggs, sausage (turkey, too), biscuits with gravy, yogurt....etc. Upon leaving, I was once again sent away with a smile. I was asked about my stay and if there was anything they could do to improve my stay....honestly....no. **I'd like to add that my husband and I were a bit worried about our young children making noise. We were on the 3rd floor and it was pretty quiet. In the morning, waiting for the elevator...we noticed the guest leaving the room right next door to ours with 2 small dogs. If they barked...we didn't hear it at all."

At the end of a 12 hour day in the car, this was a great place to pull into! The woman at the front desk was extremely nice, the room was very clean, and the beds were super comfy. Bonus, they are pet friendly, and it can be hard to find a place that will take 2 dogs. I would definitely stay here again."

(I did end up getting 2 queens). Room is small and standard - 2 beds, desk, chair, big TV, mini fridge. The hotel room was damp and musty. Even with all the lights on and window shades open, the room is dark. There was definitely a smell in the room."

2968,Holiday Inn Express - Harrisburg East,Harrisburg,2016-04-04T00:00:00Z,40.277723,-76.821103,2.0,"From the outside this appears to be a newer property, however the rooms were both worn and dirty. The light in my bathroom would not turn off, the rugs had not been vacuumed and the bed was way past it's useful life. The two co workers traveling with me expressed similar concerns, so this appears to be more than just a problem with one room."
2969,Holiday Inn Express - Harrisburg East,Harrisburg,2015-09-06T00:00:00Z,40.277723,-76.821103,3.0,"Hotel location very convenient to highways, city, Hershey. Plenty of restaurants, stores, cheap gas. Car wash across street. Free Hershey's kisses and cookies in lobby. Breakfast at 6am. Great selection, though hot food not at restaurant quality. The OJ had a musty aftertaste. I told the breakfast server, who needed clarification in Spanish, then she shrugged and did nothing. I was offered only a connecting room which I hate, nothing else available. Desk person very helpful and did give me a quiet room. Traveler should beware that they allow pets in this hotel (check!), try to keep them on 2nd floor, but this time someone slipped their dog into their room on the 5th floor which if you get a room next to a whining, barking, door scratching dog you're out of luck."
2970,Holiday Inn Express - Harrisburg East,Harrisburg,2015-01-03T00:00:00Z,40.277723,-76.821103,4.0,I booked 2 rooms for my whole family including 2 grand children for a day's stay in Hersey World and Christmas Village. Rooms were clean and fit our needs even the building is a little old.

2974,Holiday Inn Express - Harrisburg East,Harrisburg,2015-08-17T00:00:00Z,40.277723,-76.821103,4.0,"Overall the stay was good. I made an error during the original booking and needed to extend my stay by one night. I attempted to do this at the front desk and I was told everything was good to go. However, the next morning I found out that the first attempt at extending my stay was completely botched and I had to do it all over again with a new attendant. Other than that one thing, it was a pleasant stay. Nothing special, but nothing I would stay away from either."

2977,Holiday Inn Express - Harrisburg East,Harrisburg,2015-08-24T00:00:00Z,40.277723,-76.821103,1.0,"I have never written a review like this and thought the previous reviewers were exaggerating or just expecting too much from a Holiday Inn Express. I was wrong. Clearly, the hotel is trying very hard to cover up an unpleasant smell, and with no way to open a window or gain access to fresh air, the smell is truly overwhelming. When we first arrived, I thought the smell in the lobby was bad (a combination of stale smoke, damp must, and something they have sprayed to try to cover it up) but the smell in our room was even worse. There was no relief from it because the windows are sealed shut and it was too late for us to find another hotel."
2978,Holiday Inn Express - Harrisburg East,Harrisburg,2016-06-24T00:00:00Z,40.277723,-76.821103,2.0,"The room felt very damp and carried a musty odor throughout the stay. Beds were made for second night but floor not vacuumed or supplies replenished. The door wouldn't shut unless pushed very hard, even after maintenance looked at it. Breakfast was available and as a free alternative it was reasonable. (Juice was terrible...orange-flavored water at best) But hot and cold choices. When a water-outage left us high and dry (literally), I was disappointed management didn't offer up bottles of water to brush teeth, wash faces, etc. Probably wouldn't stay again. Location very close to restaurants and Hershey Park."

Other than the smell, they gave me the handicapped room with a shower that floods the floor. Besides these 2 things, the room was fine. I will never stay here again."
2984,Holiday Inn Express - Harrisburg East,Harrisburg,2015-09-27T00:00:00Z,40.277723,-76.821103,5.0,More than adequate in every way. No charge hot breakfast was surprisingly good. Topped off a nice place to stay.
2985,Holiday Inn Express - Harrisburg East,Harrisburg,2015-08-29T00:00:00Z,40.277723,-76.821103,3.0,We stayed two different nights and returned after the first night to a totally different quality of room. If second had been first we never would have returned

However my non smoking room reaked of smoke and we found a container of chewing tobacco in the bedside table. My three-year-old also pulled out two 2 x 4 is from underneath the bed. The bathroom was clean.

This room had a door delaminating, wallpaper under vanity peeling and no exhaust fan in bathroom. Main room was clean and comfortable.

We visited Hershey chocolate world and this place is not too far from it. Pros - hotel staff , room cleanliness , breakfast and neighborhood Cons - they can have few trash covers as the one they provide also not of good quality"
2998,Holiday Inn Express - Harrisburg East,Harrisburg,2016-08-19T00:00:00Z,40.277723,-76.821103,1.0,"The mattresses were very old and uncomfortable. The middle sagged so we rolled into each other. Same thing happened to my kids in the other bed. The feather pillows were old and completely flat. They kept us awake during the night with having to constantly fluff. The keyless entry was broken on the side door of the hotel. If you arrived to breakfast after 8 am it was slim pickings. The staff did not replenish items that were gone. Also, the pancake maker was broken. There were Hershey kisses in a bowl next to the elevator upon arrival. They were never replenished in the 2 days we were there. Not a big deal, but it was a cute touch that they also fell short on. The coffee was good and I was glad it was made available. For 200 a night we expected much better accommodations, not just a decent cup of coffee."

The room was clean and the beds were comfortable. We had trouble with the key not working in the door, but the staff was VERY nice and indicated that the lock was older and told us the trick to getting it to work. The breakfast area was a little small. I would stay at this hotel again, no question."

Seemed like it was 'lived in' full-time by some...(maybe...maybe not...I don't know for sure). Had a peculiar odor throughout... almost like a nursing home but a little different. Front desk person was helpful. TV operation is a challenge/PAIN. Seemed like hostess knew about it and fully expected my call about it...could have told me in advance but didn't. Heard others talking about it at breakfast next day. Some advice...get breakfast at McDonalds next door. Hotel is close to a lot of good restaurants and things. I am NOT a 5 STAR person by ANY (ANY!) means...but this just wasn't quite right. Its a NO from me. Sorry...

We attempted to check in and they said the computer wasn't working and we had a room in the same building as the couple we were meeting, but we needed to come back in three hours. They said we could have our bracelets and eat and drink by the pool. Worked for us. However, we get to the pool and the waiter says he can't help us if we don't have a room. We explained the situation and he brought us water. Luckily our friends returned shortly after and were able to get us lunch and drinks on their room. We went back to check in three hours later and were told we didn't have a room in the same building. Forty-five minutes later they are promising to make it right and our going to put us in a room so we can make our dinner reservations off site. When we checked in later, we were told that we could move for a thousand for 4 nights. Needless to say they didn't make it right. I heard several people at the pool say they had similar situations with check in. Seemed to be scam. Be prepared to have every meal at the Bistro interrupted by a woman trying to sell spa packages. Also, when the server at the pool lost my ticket he called my room and yelled at me that I took it. I explained I didn't, but still feeling bad walked back to the Sky Pool and asked him and he said he did have it and did not even apologize for yelling at me."

Fairly isolated on a cliff. Golf carts take you everywhere you need to go. Taxis info town range from 14-20 each way. Approx 60 minutes drive from airport. You cannot swim in the ocean at this particular beach due to the tough surf.

Workers trying to pressure you to purchase a time share aka welcome package presentation. No swimming at this beach. Food sucked. Taxi to downtown marina area was 14.00 and same going to hotel. This is the last hotel in Cabo. Oh and the horrific smell in the hotel. It wasn't pleasant at all. Just overall experience was just ok. I would not return.

While they do run the system well you still spend a lot of time waiting and riding or walking long distances. Room was nice they did up grade us to a nicer view on request, as the first ocean view was obstructed. Food was ok for the most part, first night buffet area was being remodeled so the available area was small and food choices minimal. Theme nights were good however seafood night lacked seafood. Other than fish you had to search for other seafood in rice, pasta or stew. Final downgrade was based on misinformation, after attending the two hour sales session we were given resort credit, some things were listed as not included golf, prepaid services, and boutique. We decided to use our credit to spread the wealth to the staff in gratuities. Upon check out we were then told gratuities were not included and we were now responsible for the amount accrued. It wasn't about the money more the deception I felt that was portrayed."

That being said, from day one they try to get you to buy a timeshare. It became annoying. You spend quite a bit of your day riding shuttles and golf carts around the property and between properties. The good thing about that is that the property is large and the sister properties are on swimable beaches. They say no cash or tips but all the receipts have a place to add a tip and everyone there expects tips in US dollars. They aren't happy about getting Mexican money even if it's 50 or 100 pesos."

We waited an hour for our food one night. Since the grounds are built on a hill, getting around is not easy and requires cart service to get around. Sometimes the wait was longer than expected for a cart to come by. We would have walked but the paths were not built for pedestrian use and could be dangerous. Food is very expensive, glad we opted for the all inclusive option. The high end restaurant LaFrida was well worth the extra 30 per person. If you don't mind wasting 3 hours, go on the time share presentation to get resort credit. We got 400 dollars which we used on two massages and the high end restaurant. Just keep in mind that they will tell you it is only 90 minutes long... which it wasn't. Don't feel bad about saying no to those salespeople. They are slimy like used car salesmen. Pay close attention to the bill when you check out, we had an issue with a very large extra charge that we found. It is unfortunate that they did not catch it first, and I didn't have to warn you. Do not do any of the buffets at La Nao, almost all the food is room temperature. There is food and drink service at the pools, but all the waiters moved at a much slower pace, and preferred to talk with each other than serve guests. Now besides the items I mentioned, it really was a nice place overall, and worth the money we paid. Probably will not return but onl"

The thing that really turned me off, however, is how hard they pushed the timeshare. I was accosted by at least a half a dozen people who were very aggressively wanting me to sign up for a presentation - and that was within the first 60-90 minutes of arriving! I finally sat through the presentation to get the hotel credits and it took 2-1/2 hours (they said it would take 90 minutes). They started off with a soft-sell which I declined. Then the manager comes over with a harder sell (I said no again), then they transferred me to a gentleman who was to finalize the credits and he was so aggressive that I had to tell him very firmly that I was NOT interested and that he was making me feel uncomfortable. Then HIS manager came over and he was so rude. I was really upset after that. So, while I loved the property, I will NEVER go back because of that."

Food was good for an all inclusive resort. Room was very large size with a beautiful ocean view. Sunset Beach is a large size resort over a cliff which requires walking long distances or golf card type of transportation. We like to walk so we loved it. The only downside of the resort is that you can't swim in the ocean but they shuttle you to their sister resorts for swimming. Excellent experience. I will recommended it to my friends."

Almost 50 different buildings located on different steps of a mountain. Food was god, lots of different options. This is a big big resort and yes size does matter. When I first heard this resort is huge and some people were complaining about it. I was wondering how being so big can be a bad thing. Well, its not bad but it is not so good either for a family. If I were in my 20's, I would have absolutely love this huge resort. You can either jump on a golf cart or just jump, run and walk from one building to other. It would give me an opportunity to digest all the all inclusive foods also. But when you have a four month old infant with you, this might not be that good. Carrying the infant in your lap and making sure neither your infant nor his stroller falls of the cart when golf carts are moving fast through the hill could be a challenge. There is no way you can park your car next to your building. You have to self park or valet park close to lobby area and than take a golf cart to go to your room. Now if you are either on third floor or first floor you have to take the stairs to go to your room. None of this matter if your are young or energetic, it is rather fun. But with family, specially with an infant fun could become a challenge easily."

Expedia lists gratuities as included in the package, however we received an itemized bill after every meal which included a tip line. It became clear that servers expected tips from the all-inclusive customers as well. When we asked the front desk and time-share sales staff, we received different answers. The most common being that gratuities are included, but if you receive exceptional service you should feel free to tip your waiter above and beyond the included portion. We were finally told that 5 of our all-inclusive fee was split amongst all the staff, and the waiters only earn 75 pesos a day in wages. Therefore, they count on tips as part of their wages, and apparently the 5 doesn't really do the trick. Not wanting to rip off the staff, I gave additional tips. If I had started my vacation expecting to tip, I would have enjoyed my first few days much more than I did. The disconnect between my expectations and reality were a cause of tension, not only for me, but for other customers that I spoke to as well. 2. When we arrived they didn't have our junior suite ready, so they put us in another room which didn't have a safe, had a leak and puddle in the hallway outside the room, didn't have a working microwave, and took 5 minutes for the hot water in the shower to heat up. 3. The beach is not safe or open to swimming. 4. Two of the restaurants were up-sells, about 30 per head, and only 4 wines included in the pkg."

It offered each family member an experience of a lifetime. The hotel was clean and beautiful. The staff was friendly and efficient. I am not sure if they added extra golf carts for the holiday but the longest we had to wait was 10 minutes.

Check-in was great, Sergio upgraded the two double bed suites we had booked to a presidential suite. The suite had two bedrooms, two full bathrooms, a kitchen, dining, and living area. Best of all it came with a jacuzzi with an oceanview patio. It was perfect for me and my girls! The food was really good compared to what I've had at the Riu. The staff was super friendly and helpful. My only complaint is that the hotel is so big that you have to take a golf cart everywhere, whether it's to go eat or swimming at the pool."

The views are breathtaking, cliff side overlooking the ocean, but the whole resort is build on a hill and it's impossible to navigate it with a stroller, or walk (unless you love the stair-master machine at the gym). So no long walk after dinner with the stroller to calm down baby. Our building also had a hot water problem, and they started digging a huge whole right in front of it (making sure the shuttles couldn't drive to our building). We spent 4 days without hot water, taking cold showers and boiling water on the stove top to give baby a bath. Ridiculous. The hotel didn't offer any compensation, discount or new room. Also, you cannot swim in the ocean, so pool only."

Staff was friendly and the food was definitely better than most all inclusive resorts. Overall we enjoyed the stay. Some of the things I did not like was room service was extremely slow, horrible mattresses. Absolutely hated the idea of wearing a bracelet for the duration of 9 days stay. Had to make reservations for most restaurants. Lots of extra charges for all inclusive packages."

This ocean is on pacific side where they don't even allow you to go near ocean due to fast currents, . 2. Hotel is built on a mountain side , so to travel between lobby and your room or restaurants you have to either walk uphill or wait for golf carts which is usually long queues and infrequent services. 3. Timeshares agents are roaming all around in the hotel and won't even allow you to eat in restaurants (as they keep disturbing you almost every time).. As soon as you land to hotel, everyone comes to you with their pitches to join a breakfast tour(Timeshare meeting).. 4. Room is not quite as you can hear golf cart roaming in middle of night, hard to sleep ... 5. All Inclusive is a scam as they don't have good vegan food (Hardly any dishes in any restaurant( they can international cuisines) nor all good liquors are charged outside of your all inclusive plan). Overall I think I could have chosen better hotel on the tourist corridor in the price I paid to this property."

Beautiful views and nice pools. Very friendly staff. They did try to sell timeshares on our first day but weren't pushy about it. Something to know is to reserve your seats on the shuttle the day before if you want to go to the other sister hotel."

It is very different now. Very crowded, the food is not as good, and the staff seem overwhelmed. It is difficult to get a cart to take you place to place ( the resort is too hilly so it's hard to walk to your destination in the heat). Many times I would call the front desk, restaurant for a reservation or even to get a cart and no one would answer. It seems like all the hotel wants to do is sell timeshares. Needless to say I was disappointed in my recent stay"

The new facilities like sky pool and newer buildings/pools are well laid out and prevent congestion in one area. The resort is comfortable and quiet. Food at Bistro and Shen Zao are good. Guests are not snooty. No parties going on here, which is for other resorts, so there is a resort where peace and quiet for the most part exists, thank god! Watch out for the golf carts, they tend to be in a race to get somewhere fast."

I've used these perks at numerous +VIP hotels in the past without any problems at all but the manager at this hotel refused to honor anything and gave me and my whole family a hard time. I accepted his horrible attitude and moved on because I did not have a choice since everything was prepaid. Note** Expedia gave me credits after my trip was completed to make up for this and they hadn't had the slightest clue as to why we were treated so badly. Pools were nice and the food was pretty good. Room service is the biggest joke I've ever seen in my life. I called for food one night and it came 2 hours later. Another time I requested a rollaway bed and it came 4 hours later after numerous phone calls and complaining. last night there I called for some liquor because this seems to be the only hotel without any liquor stocked in the room and they said they could only give me 2 beers per person. I said fine and after 4 calls over 2 more hours, the beer finally arrives hot like lava and I was so frustrated with the staff it made me sick. They have this one lady who answers the phones after 9PM and she seriously must have been hating her job because she sounded like the mafia to me and hung up on me. I truly hated this experience and will never ever ever go here again (obviously) and I highly recommend noone else 2"

We had Roberto that was our attendant poolside. He was terrific. Roberto made sure our drinks were always full and refreshed. The poolside food was very good also.

Sky pool had amazing views! I can't say enough good things about this place. We also went over to the Sister Resort (Pueblo Bonito Rose), and our resort was MUCH nicer, and the service was also MUCH better, so I'd highly recommend Sunset over Rose. The food was delicious, and the Asian Restaurant was absolutely phenomenal (we had a group of 10). Our waiter (Gerardo) was amazing! This resort is definitely worth every penny!"

The hounded you to do the time share presentation. And our ground transportation that we paid for was available and had to pay additional fees

Fairly isolated on a cliff. Golf carts take you everywhere you need to go. Taxis info town range from 14-20 each way. Approx 60 minutes drive from airport. You cannot swim in the ocean at this particular beach due to the tough surf. Also - beware upon arrival you will be harassed by multiple people (namely Martha) into paying to attend a brunch for a timeshare pitch.

The property was gorgeous and everything seemed to run so smoothly. You are able to take a free shuttle to the sister resort where there is a swimmable beach, which is a nice perk. We did, however, like our resort much much better. The views of the pacific are so gorgeous and there are six pools, so you definitely don't miss being on a public beach. We had a few issues with timeliness of service the last day. The front desk personnel said they would give us a credit, but we never received that. Other than that, we had we had a great time and will probably be back."

Ok so when I'm done with my water in 30 minutes I'll call for another one Lol, just seemed stupid. All inclusive and we can't have more then 16 ounces of water per person Weve been in the sun all day and we are thirsty, sorry I can only bring 3, 1 per person.

It has a beautiful stretch of beach, however you are not allowed to enter the ocean because of the dangerous rip currents. Also, this is a timeshare resort, so be prepared to be approached often to attend information meetings and/or to buy. After awhile this was irritating."

We always mentioned it as a possible vacation as we all wanted to go back. We planned the trip and confirmed three rooms as our kids had friends coming with them. When we arrived our room wasnt ready (we were early). But they were having trouble finding three rooms let alone 3 rooms close together. The front desk manager came out and asked us to go into one of the villas at montechristo. This was an upgrade but we were hesitant because we had no idea about the room set up and the distance. The manager assured us we would be just as close as the building we were in before. We were also promised 200 off resort charges. The villa was beautiful but we were as far away as could be. We had to call for a shuttle which frequently took 10-15 minutes just to get to the edge of the resort then walk or ride a golf cart to the pools and restaurants. We had an hour wait on a shuttle one night trying to return to our villa. When I went in to complain, I was told that there was only one shuttle for 4 adjacent resorts. Room service was never less than an hour because they had the same issues in getting to us. The distance was a big problem and I feel the front desk was very misleading just to get us to solve their problem. At checkout, no one could find where the manager had given us the resort credit(it was written on a voucher we presented)"

Food was great and the drinks were awesome! Very clean hotel and I would recommend visiting this hotel. Only thing is that you can walk around the resort easily due to steep hills, but there are plenty of golf carts w/drivers getting you around the entire resort which is HUGE fyi. My wife got sick 1 day but cant really say if was from the hotel food since we had gone into town to try the local food. Cannot go into the ocean at this resort but you can at their sister hotel Pueblo Bonito Rose, we went 1 day but the ocean is really rough and not good for little kids. My older daughter and I did swim in the ocean but it wasn't easy. I would visit this hotel again in the future. Please get a shuttle included in the package deal, they charge 80 each way to hotel/airport if you pay when you get to the airport."

It is high pressure marketing to buy into their properties from the moment you arrive until departure time. Even after we saw the presentation, before calling up a cab for us to go to town, the staff would ask us if we'd seen the presentation and made us feel uncomfortable to leave the property. The is a complete lack of consistency throughout the hotel, the food would come out differently each time. For example one night we ate at the Japanese restaurant and really enjoyed it so we returned only to be very disappointed. We had to ask several times for ginger and wasabi and never received it, our order was completely wrong and the food was not nearly as good. That night we asked for bottled water (we had the all inclusive plan) and the bartender would only give us one each - that only happened at one of the pool bars near our room. The hotel is inconveniently located quite far from town and although the beach is beautiful there it is not swimmable. The staff did not seem well traveled and many of them could come across as indifferent or rude at times. Beautiful on the surface but lacking in quality of product."

You have to sign restaurant style tickets for everything you do. Every water, beer, meal, everything it gets old fast. Everytime to hit the swim up bar it's another ticket to sign. We stayed at over 15 all inclusive resorts in the last 12 years first time I've ever seen this. I mean isn't this the point of the wrist band!! No mini bad in room. No bottled water, beer, soda not even in room coffee... Also ran in to some pretty rude staff. I've been told no so many times at a resort before. I will never stay here again."

The hotel grounds are extremely large so please be aware that there is a lot of uphill walking or waiting for the shuttle carts the wait is not long since there are numerous carts throughout the facility.

When I did not buy they got mad. When I ask for a taxi to the airport they told me I had to buy a ticket them, they charge me 135.00. When I gave the ticket to the taxi driver he told me the hotel pays him 75.00. And also told me that no ticket needed, the hotel is a big scam non stop. Beware of this place. I also notice they scam other people non stop. I will never return to this place. The beds are hard and the pillows are cheap. The pools are falling apart and very dirty. Sometimes it takes 45 minutes to get a ride. I'm very unhappy. Beware first timers they will take advantage of you. All the workers are in on it, they all know everything everywhere you go and what you do, feels like you being followed.."

This place is very well run. Everything is very clean and well maintained. We stayed for one week and the food was excellent, our favorite is the Asian and Sushi restaurant. Sky pool has stuning views especially during sunset. You can take a free shuttle to the sister resort Rose in downtown area where you can swim in the ocean. There is so many things to do for kids and the Fun Lab was my kids favorite place to hang kit in the evenings. We will definitely be back next year."

Unfortunately the front desk staff isn't so helpful or professional in how they handle issues which many have. They will go back and fourth with you regarding their policy etc but never show any type of compassion or customer service when its needed most. I would NEVER go back because without customer service a business can never be what I need as a paying customer. Long check in process and lines along with very little options for lunch and dinning late at night. Beautiful but so not worth all the other headaches and disappointments.

The only problem we had was the time it took to get checked in. May be our large size group was the reason for delay at the check in counter. They need to keep more people in staff specially at the restaurants as the service was too slow. I would not blame existing staff for the slow service. I would definitely go again at this property.

Maid service could have been better, not consistent or thorough. Food and drinks were great throughout, since we had all inclusive we used as much as we could. Wifi was included for 2 devices but we kept loosing signal and got charged international data by our mobile service. Could have had more activities at the pools, plus they charged us 5 each to play tennis even though we were on the all inclusive plan. We decided to take the time share presentation only because we got the right salesperson (Blanca) who ended up giving us 6 excursions instead of the resort credit after some negotiations we with her. The presentation was actually good and they didn't push us to hard to purchase."

We had Roberto that was our attendant poolside. He was terrific. Roberto made sure our drinks were always full and refreshed. The poolside food was very good also. The room was a one bedroom large room with a full kitchen and a large living room dining area with a large balcony overlooking the Pacific Ocean.

The rooms are clean and nice, there are a lot of swimming pools to choose from. The only thing is you cannot swim in the beach but you can go to their sister resort the Rose to swim in the beach. The food was good specially the Champagne brunch on Sundays. That Sunday brunch was very good. The only thing is that don't have nightly entertainment which is present in all all inclusive places I've been to."

It was on a hill and most rooms have beautiful views of the ocean. Food in pool bars was good. No swimming on the beach. They need to give staff more training in customer service. No activities at night. Time share agents should not be allowed to bother customers inside the restaurants.

Oh and my deluxe suite was leaking all night on my last night there!"

It has a ton of people and is generally a fun and busy atmosphere, but I would say if you love being on the actual beach swimming in the water, stay at the PB Rose. Its right on the water. My family enjoyed this resort because the amenities were on point, amazing food drinks etc, but I love the water, so if I could I would have been in the ocean the entire time. Just depends on what you like. And since the resort is basically on the side of the mountain, you have to take golf carts everywhere, which were no big deal. But again, it depends on what you like. If you are mid to late twenties, take the lesser amenities at Rose. If you are late thirties with or without a family, go here. Really no complaints."

Give us a big suite instead of Jr suite. Then we find out they don't have Jr. Suite so why I be charged extra. The next they they changed and moved our staff with out our knoladge. We got into somebody else's room so our keys were still working. We went to the Loby 4 times every time waited in the line for hours.

Because the first night, I didn't get the room I had reserved.. but they fix the problem until 3:00pm the next day. Overall beautiful hotel and staff!"

Most of the time waiting 10 minutes or more. The air conditioner in our room went out at 3am, they didn't fix out till almost 5 and it was very hot and humid. No mini bar or anything in the room upon arrival so you have to order room service to get anything. The service at the pools is terrible, sometimes waiting 30 minutes at the pool bar to get a drink and the bar wasn't even busy. If you do all inclusive you're treated terribly, they see that band on your wrist and they ignore you because they think you're not going to tip. We ended up leaving this place a night early and going to another hotel in Cabo because the service was so bad."

It was out firsttime doign all iclusive and we love it. Every meal was very well prepared and the atmosphere was so comforting and inviting. We loved the kindness of ALL the staff, but special shouts out to Alfredo, Erik,Erizabeth. Loved their prsonality and willness to go the extra mile. The grounds were very well kept and the workers all took pride in their job. We had one incident that repeated itself everyday. There were 4 of us in a junior suite, we had to request more towels EVERY day..One day we didin't get any. The housekeeper would only leave 2 wash cloths, handtowels and bath towels when she did. We were ther for 6 days. Other than that, grat place for vacation. We bought in and will definitely be returning. Ole!"

I really cant think of anything slightly negative besides the fact that this hotel has no beach access and its really far away from the airport, about 40min away other than that you will enjoy your time specially in a Presidential suite."

The all inclusive is definitely worth it. Like people mentioned, there are some time share people that will chat you up a bit but since we are both under 30, they left us alone very quickly. I'm sure they assume you have to be that age to even be considered a prospect. Also, you can't swim in the ocean but it's really not a big deal. We took some nice walks on the beach and hung out at the pools all day. Bartenders there took great care of us! and it was very easy to catch golf carts and rides around the property. Would definitely go back :)"

You have to go to their other property Ros to swim at the beach. Otherwise, the pools are amazing here, food, premium drinks, service were all great!"

The staff was constantly pressuring us to go to the presentation to buy into the the development. I found myself trying to hid from them. The beach is unusable due to the staff keeping us from the beach surf because some people drowned. They didn't tell me in advance of these things. I believe I'll stay somewhere else next time.
3166,Pueblo Bonito Sunset Beach Resort & Spa - All Inclusive,Virginia Beach,2016-08-05T00:00:00Z,22.875315,-109.930688,3.0,The trip was good overall but the complex is so big that taking a cart around was the only way to get anywhere. The carts should come around every 5 minutes but it was more like 20-30 minutes. When you first arrive they have a company that sells you cheaper excursions at a discount if you go to the property time share and what they don't tell you is you will still need to pay more fee's when you get to the excursion. Don't try to get a refund becuase they will pass you around from supervisiors to Managers.

During check-in it was promised they will arrange wifi for all four guests. But it never worked. Only two can connect simultaneously and when went to support they just mentioned the front desk staff provided incorrect information. Service is very slow and delayed every time. SPA and message was good. Food was average. The Sunday brunch was nice. Zau Shen and La Nao were better. Pool was fun and Sky Pool party was the highlight. Overall it was just average than I expected to be!

The food was good. 99 of the staff were friendly and helpful. The services at the spa were dreamy. The front desk staff were lackluster in customer service at check in and check out. The room we booked was unavailable and they initially downgraded us (family of 4 with 3 people 6 feet tall and over) and added roll away beds. But after a stern discussion the next day we got much better accommodations. Timeshare sales people were pushy for the first 3 days but then backed off. Pools were nice. View was amazing. Waking and falling asleep to the lapping of the ocean - priceless.

My main disappointment is that 'all inclusive' doesn't apply to all resteraunts (upcharge for the three nicest eateries) and activities (tennis, as an example). I don't believe the Expedia description accurately reflected this or it was in the small print that I didn't read. Also, you must be prepared for the wind on the Pacific side of Cabo. It's very windy this time of year."
3172,Pueblo Bonito Sunset Beach Resort & Spa - All Inclusive,Virginia Beach,2016-08-08T00:00:00Z,22.875315,-109.930688,2.0,"CONS: The front desk was business with a smirk not a smile. This resort is built alongside the non-swimmable beach of Cabo. The views are magnificent but the currents are so strong that you absolutely positively can not get close. YOU WILL DIE NO MATTER HOW GOOD OF A SWIMMER YOU ARE! Four people died in it last month alone! This resort is also build on a huge property alongside a mountain/hill. You will be totally exhausted if you want to walk to any of it's main locations. Fortunately they have drivers driving golf carts to take you everywhere on the property and they are very accessible. The problem is that they also pollute the air with the gasoline smell, which is not very pleasant. Their driveway from start to the lobby is about a 5-7 minute drive. What makes it unpleasant is the entire road is made of beautifully laid pavers which make for a very bump ride. Because this resort is away from the main action (swimmable side of the beach, which I found is still not very swimmable), they have a free shuttle, which was always full, to take you to and from their sister hotel called Rose. I had to pay 14 each way twice to go to the beach. Ana at Rose didn't give a **** that the shuttles couldn't accommodate extra people needing a ride to/from the resort. She refused to be of any assistance saying I was the other hotel's problem. The solution was to book in advance which was still always booked. Anyway, the food was mediocre and very expensive for what you got."

It was at 98 occupancy and because the property was so large, you hardly ever see anyone. The AC was on point everywhere you go, the hotel was extremely clean, my room was awesome. The jacuzzi on the porch was awesome.. I seriously cant say enough good stuff about it. I was so happy with our 7 days there that we booked another trip in January.. Hope to see you there.."

Even with the all-inclusive plan, they still require us to sign a bill at each dinning, including snacks, this is really a nuisance, and there is nothing stock in the refrigerator (no water or soda). I feel the administrators invest more on the resort landscape, which is beautiful, than their guess. Overall we were not satisfied with our vacation at this resort and will never return."

Wait time were a bit long during breakfast and dinner at the restaurants. The beds were not comfortable. They appeared to be old with a pillow top thrown on it. Couch was too small and very uncomfortable unless unfolded. Otherwise great trip we would stay there again! Amazing food!!"

When you stay at sunset you feel like they roll out the red carpet. We went to visit their sister company rose. Seems like we made the better choice staying at sunset. Quality staff and guest.

3185,Hampton Inn Abilene,Abilene,2015-10-03T00:00:00Z,32.40399,-99.76546,3.0,"One of the main reasons we chose this hotel was because it had an indoor pool and hot tub. The hot tub did not work, and I was told it did upon arrival. After telling the front desk about it, they still continued to tell others as they checked in that the pool and hot tub was available. There was no available plug for the coffee maker, it had to be moved and the tv unplugged in order to use it. The coffee and iced tea in the lobby was wonderful. The breakfast was good too."

The staff was great and very pleasant on check in and departure. The room was clean and comfortable and away from the street and road noise. Although, I could hear the family next door, it was not unpleasant nor did the noise keep me awake. I enjoyed the use of the fitness room and the delicious hot and cold breakfast buffet. I would recommend this hotel and will probably stay there in the future."

I would totally give it 5 stars if it weren't for the unfriendly breakfast buffet woman. It was so not busy when we were there on 9/29 and I went up to the counter at 9am to see what was there and she didn't even seem to notice me come up right next to her. I said good-morning and she never even looked up or acknowledged me! Really! Such an impolite worker in such a great hotel. She never said a thing to me or my husband the whole breakfast long and we sat right next to the food (it's a small place). I don't need or even like lots of conversation or loud talking in the morning, but common courtesy and friendliness is paramount in hotel service. Also, there was a discussion going on between her, the front desk girl and another employee (manager) who wore a lanyard around her neck and no uniform. It was about the schedule and some issues with regard to it. The person not wearing the uniform actually came up to the breakfast bar, still talking to someone at the front desk and said, Well, you made the schedule, so I do blame you! Don't mind us customers here trying to have our breakfast folks. So, Hampton management, you lost a star because of unprofessional and unfriendly behavior of two employees. The rest of it was excellent!"

I specifically asked Hotels.com when I made the reservation to make absolutely sure I was able to have a roll away bed for our 12 year old son.

Our hotel room door did not lock. there is a sign on the door that tells ppl it automatically locks but it doesnt. We told staff and they said theyd fix it. When we got back at night we found that our door was still unlocked and it was unlocked all day! We told them again and they said they forgot to fix it. Someone eventually came and replaced the lock after questioning if we knew how to use the door (um i know how to use a door). The mattresses are very uncomfortable but the room was clean and u get what u pay for. When we went to check out we and a few other guests stood at the front desk for about 10 mins until someone came to check us out. Unexceptible during busy check out hours

It was dark and poorly lit, and the walls were paper thin. The neighbors were noisy, and if someone jumped upstairs, the whole place shook. The bathroom was dark and had no ventilation, and when you turned on the sink, it made a loud noise. It was not the worst place we could have stayed, but it certainly wasn't glamorous."
3316,Tidewater Inn,West Yarmouth,2016-07-28T00:00:00Z,41.657447,-70.261804,3.0,Was just looking for something affordable that was still close to the beach and towns. This was decent for the price and was even able to book an extra night since we saved on money!

They charged my card after I made the reservation when I was told it would only be used if we were a no show or cancelled (paying cash on arrival as per the website and emails). The card was denied and the room cancelled with no notice, I did get an email 34 minutes prior to arrival asking for feedback on my check in. We the had to track sown a vacant room on a Friday night and paid significantly more money. I will be reviewing this place on Yelp as they have a poor way of doing business"

The staff also was very friendly and having an indoor and an outdoor pool is something you rarely find in this category. Also the on-site fifties diner for breakfast is a nice touch."

The 'Game Room' was 2 video games and a pinball machine next to 3 vending machines in a hallway. Dirty towels and garbage were not removed by staff when room was done. Bathroom smelled of mold/mildew. Restaurant staff did not wear gloves when handlng food. A good scrubbing and painting are needed.

When we checked in front desk said they couldnt word it as public balcony, so needless to say, not private and they said we could pay more to get one. Ac was loud, they did come and fix it, but then room was warm. Ac was bad. Service was good. Mini golf next door fun! Overall would stay again for cheap ratewat"

The motel is older but very nicely kept up. The grounds are beautifully landscaped with flowers. It is a large motel with lots of rooms, lots of space, two pools and a very nice little restaurant on site. As I said, the motel is old but well maintained. The rooms are clean. The TV is old (not a flatscreen) and the mattress has seen better days, but the room had small fridge, coffemaker, hairdryer, iron, phone, radio, cable TV and Wifi. The pool is nice and is 9 feet deep in the deep end. Music playing at the pool made it very welcoming. We didn't use the indoor pool. There are swings, picnic areas and the property borders a lovely cove. The best part was their 1950's decor restaurant where we had breakfast. Very good food and very good service. Nicely decorated and very clean. We would stay at the Tidewater again - and hope our room has a newer mattress."

3336,Tidewater Inn,West Yarmouth,2015-10-18T00:00:00Z,41.657447,-70.261804,3.0,The Tidewater Inn is a good place to stay if you are looking for a comfortable bed to come back to after a day of sightseeing or at the beach. The Inn is simple but perfectly allright if you'd rather spend your money on a good meal or something else. The staff and manager were also very friendly. No breakfast is included but you can get breakfast at the diner on site or in other restaurants nearby. Hyannis also has enough places to offer for breakfast.

Chose this hotel because of reasonable price and both indoor and outdoor pools and hot tub, and proximity to downtown Hyannis. Staff and room were pleasant. Walk to town was a little longer than we would have preferred. The outdoor pool was cold because of the weather, but the indoor pool was also very chilly and we were extremely disappointed to see the hot tub had been ripped out. Also, we would have liked to check out at 7:30 am, but the office was still closed. We could have called to have someone come out, but chose to come back later. Overall, a nice enough place for the price, but no extras."

The shower pressure was like a power washer and not suitable for small kids. the Wi-Fi didn't reach our room. There is no 24 hours lobby so there was no one to call when there was a party in the parking lot and people were up all hours partying right outside our door. The staff is all new and the new owners stated they bought the Inn a month ago and were unable to make changes due to the season having already started and stated big changes were coming. I tend to believe them as they were all great people they just happened purchased a motel that needs a lot of work. so due to the smell, water, and lack of security this is one of the worst if not the worst hotel experience I have ever had. Id love my money back but I know there's no hope of that."

The plumbing was old and it water hammered all night. Each flush from upstairs echoed through the room. Then the water hammered when the tank filled. The upstairs tenants stomped the night away. There was a nice breakfast place at the indoor pool house. Housekeeping did a good job. Not a great place for a good night sleep.

There is definitely not frills here but it's a clean, comfortable room with all the basics you need such as comfortable beds, WI-fi, tub/shower, separate area with sink outside of bathroom (which I love), small fridge, blow dryer, shampoo and lotion. The tv is old, but worked fine. The Wi-Fi also worked great. You can walk down the road 0.8 miles to a nice little beach, not good for swimming but perfect for a night time rondevous to just sit and watch the water/fireworks/moon, etc. All hotel personnel were polite and efficient, especially considering it was 4th of July on Cape Cod!! The outdoor swimming pool is perfect, we really enjoyed that one morning. Our only complaint is that the walls are paper thin, you can hear someone sneeze in the next room like they are right in the room with you. There really isn't anything you can do about that though, especially when the hotel is sold out. If you're traveling on a budget and just want a good place to sleep, shower, relax at the pool then this is what you're looking for. Oh, and there is free morning coffee in their on-site diner!"

This made hanging out in the room at night much more comfortable - or 2 extra people could have stayed in the room. The grounds were nice. We did not get to use either of the pools, but did see others using them. There is complementary coffee/tea from 7-10 A. M. but you have to walk across the parking lot to the hotel's diner to get it - not a huge distance, but you do need to go outside. Same for the indoor pool. The front desk staff were all very nice and helpful. The housekeeping could have been better. They didn't leave enough cups and towels in the room each day - we had to get more from the office.

Woke me up in the middle of the night!!! I had bite marks all on the side of my one foot that touches the mattress when I sleep. They itch like mad! I told the supervisor in duty and he said he would notify manager Lisa. She never called me! Very bad business.

This time we were traveling with our one-year-old child and the last place wasn't the nicest so I decided to spend a little more money to try to get something a little nicer. Wrong. It's an old fashioned drive-up motor lodge. Our room smelled so strongly of bleach when we arrived, I wondered what that smell was covering up. I had a partial answer soon after when I opened the curtains to discover a pair of dirty mens underwear on the floor behind them. The sliding glass door didn't lock other than a big wooden stick which didn't leave me with a lasting sense of security. Speaking of security, none of the keys worked right. The key to open the door to the hallway and the room both required a considerable amount of jiggling to free the lock. I feel badly for anyone stayed near the outside door as it slammed behind with huge BOOM. The TV was one of the old-school standard def models from 20 years ago and was pretty representative the place in general. It was probably last renovated many years ago and it's very tired now. They installed a drop ceiling in the bathroom and for some reason the tub was about a foot off the ground which left my head about an inch from the ceiling. The mattress was old and was about as luxurious as sleeping on a park bench. If you stayed here and loved it, great. I will not be back."

It was good to have a balcony, I would recommend to ask for the second floor, you can keep the balcony door open and don't use air conditioner all the time. This place is close to Hyannis and other cute places with great seafood restaurants. We were impressed by Heritage park in Sandwich and would highly recommend to visit it if you like nature. Chattam has a very interesting port and lighthouse. Hotel personnel is very friendly, Lisa gave a lot of helpful information. If you don't have a coffeemaker, ask it at front desk. In general a lot of great memories and happy with this very convenient and affordable place."

I decided I wanted a third night, so I called the hotel directly to ask if our room would be available on Friday. I was told it was available and that I did not need to give a credit card number to hold the reservation. When I checked in at the hotel on Wednesday, my two-day Expedia reservation was fine, but there was no record of my conversation with the hotel clerk from the previous week. I was very upset that I had just driven hours to find out my vacation was compromised. I was also pretty angry, and expressed this to the hotel owner, demanding that he honor my need for a room on Friday because his employee failed to reserve the room for me. He felt that I was making a scene, and threatened to cancel my Expedia reservation, saying I could find somewhere else to stay. I didn't want to lose my entire vacation, so when he vaguely promised to find me another room for Friday, I thanked him. There aren't enough characters allowed to go describe everything that happened in my three days there. The worst of it was, when we finally settled the Friday night room situation, we ended up getting locked out of our room by the hotel, claiming it wasn't paid for. The owner put the reservation for the night under his own name, and he himself processed my credit card on Wednesday when I checked in, yet his staff claimed it wasn't there. The Tidewater Inn nearly ruined my only vacation this year. Do not stay there!!!!"

The staff was pleasant upon check-in, but we were a bit disappointed with the old feeling of the room, lack of light in the shower, etc. We were out and about most of the afternoon and evening, and when I pulled back the covers to get in bed at about 11:30, a reddish-brown bug was trying to scurry out of sight. I caught it and confirmed in an online image search that it was indeed a bedbug. We tore up the covers and found another. Out of curiosity, we looked at the other bed in the room and didn't see any, but we did notice it was wrapped in a mattress cover that our bed didn't have...perhaps evidence that someone knew there was a problem (which obviously wasn't eradicated) We'd heard bedbug infestation horror stories so we packed everything up, called the night manager to tell her we would be seeking alternate accommodations and dropped our key in the slot. The night manager advised us to talk to another manager in the morning. The next morning my husband talked to the manager and although she was reluctant to give us a complete refund (citing Expedia fees, etc), she did agree and we received a refund. After returning home from our trip we called to request additional compensation for our trouble of leaving to find another (more expensive) hotel at midnight but not surprisingly didn't get a response. Fortunately we didn't bring any bugs home with us."

Parking was right iutside, so no long walks out obscure doorways to get the luggage in. Elevator was there centrally. Ok breakfast: the advertised continental with oatmeal added.

I'm so confused why they are even advertised on Expedia. The walls the smell was just horrible. This room/hotel should've been 20 max. It was so nasty. There was black mold on the torn wallpaper walls. The bed smelled. It was so uncomfortable. It didn't even feel clean. I didn't get under the covers. I sleep on my own travel blanket on top of their covers. I seriously hated it. I felt so tricked. Cigarettes marks on the counter. I felt like I was in some drug invested crapy building. I couldn't get my money back because of the no refund thing. I booked bc I missed my flight. Just horrid. I want my money back.

The room was much smaller than anticipated the bathroom was tiny with bath towels that were thin and so undersized that they were only slightly larger than hand towels. The room was clean,however, and we slept ok. Our biggest complaint was that we did not get the wake-up call we asked for and the airport shuttle was more than 15 minutes late. The person at the front desk was dismissive, saying that she ordered the call and that was all she could do and that the shuttle driver would be there. Thank heavens we woke on our own and had given ourself a 30 minute cushion in addition to the two hours that we had planned for our international flight. We do not recommend this hotel. There are plenty of other options."

This time, my first room had an AC unit which wasn't functioning properly, so the room was about 80 degrees upon check-in. It didn't promptly cool down, so I requested a new room. The new room smelled like wet towels, but at least they were cool wet towels. I decided to make a go of it. The fan would not run steadily, cycling on and off the whole night. Unfortunately, the inconsiderate idiots in the room next door were talking loud/yelling until 2 AM, and I then continued to hear their TV through the wall until 3 AM. I had an early flight and got ZERO sleep. I've never had a night with less sleep. This hotel is great for its convenience to the airport.

I would say I was thoroughly impressed seeing how this was the cheaper of hotels next to the airport. It isn't the best hotel I've ever stayed at but being last minute it is a 5 star compared to what I left. I don't ask for much, relative quietness, clean and a working AC. They made the marks in all departments on top of the bed being extremely comfortable. They do have shuttles to the airport. The breakfast options isn't huge, but you are right next to the outdoor mall with a Cracker Barrel if you are a breakfast person. Only downfall I say is the shower heads need to be upgraded.

It does not have an armoire, a desk, a chest of drawers, or a closet and there is only a bed-side table and light on one side of the bed. It does have a table with a desk chair and a love seat and a shelf over the A/C unit to put suitcases. The rod for hanging clothes is very poorly placed in the approximate two feet between the bed and the wall, making it extremely awkward to get out of the bed on that side duck or hit your head. An iron and ironing board hang in the bathroom. The lavatory is in the bathroom and has little counter space. The room does have a refrigerator and microwave and a nice flat screen TV hanging on the wall. The bed was comfortable and the motel was reasonably priced for the area.

WiFi was good, Bed was good, and room was nice enough given the age. That said my rooms A/C unit seems to have a clogged drain or something as there was musty smell in my room. But the Bed and Pillows were clean and soft. I'll stay here again for a Jags game. Would like to point out, those not from the area, the water did smell funny, but not Hotels fault I only mention it for others I have seen reviews in the JAX area. It's the water of the area, unless you know a hotel with a filtration system, they will all smelly sulfury."

I stay at this La Quinta each time I need to spend the night for the dog show. It is conveniently located by I-65 and I enjoy the free breakfast allowing me extra time to get ready so I don't have to rush off and find breakfast somewhere. I also love the indoor pool so I can swim even in nasty weather, and adore having the hot tub to relax after a long day running in the ring with my dogs."

Several electrical outlets not working. My daughter screamed through the night b/c there was something sharp sticking her through the pillow. Room smelt of mildew. Was moist and muggy. Manager of hotel notified and I was told he couldn't do anything about it b/c I booked through a 3rd party -Hotel.com. Didn't even recieve an apology. Horrible stay. Never again

Answered all questions politely and went out the way to make facilities available. The room was normal size and clean. The pool was heated. (not a spa type of heat but not ice cold either) The pool area is nice and the pool was clean with no overly bleach smell. The breakfast was typical of the hotel standard.

It was during finals week, and since I also work for housing on campus, it's the busiest time of the year with everyone moving out. I really needed to just get away for a night to keep my sanity. Upon checking in, the staff was fairly nice. However the next morning, I felt as though we were being judged for being young. Both of us are 21, and it felt as though the staff were annoyed with us from the moment we walked downstairs for breakfast."

Had stayed in this same hotel before but this particular room had gum on carpet and gap in the door that you could see out in the hall. Biggest problem was that it took about 4 hours for the air conditioner to cool the room. Room was so humid and musty smelling. Second the place is pet friendly and is not advertised as such and if I would have known would have stayed elsewhere due to my child's allergies.

When we got there, they gave us a smoking room that smelled and looked horrible. When I asked if we could move to a non-smoking room, like we had booked, they said that the room was a non-smoking room (then why was there an ashtray on the sink) and that someone must have broken the rules and smoked in the room previously. They said they were completely booked and could not move us. We had to keep the window open during our entire stay (low of 25 degrees one night) just so we could breathe. There were stains all over the walls from where people had been smoking in that room for a long time. There were also body hairs in the shower when we got there. Not just one or two, but multiple hairs all over the tub. When we went down for breakfast Sunday morning at 7am, both trash cans were completely full and people had begun leaving their trash on the tables. We never saw an employee while we were down there. I have stayed with LaQuinta multiple times before and have never had an issue. I will definitely never stay at this location again after this terrible experience."

This motel was on the lower end of the LaQuinta scale. Room was not bad, but less clean than expected, maybe just showing wear. Breakfast service had no juice (we are not coffee drinkers). Machine was broken and no alternate was provided."

All of their king bed rooms are on the noisy highway side. They dont tell u that unless u ask. Fridge was noisy in our 2nd room carpet had dirt all over it. There is no way it was vaccuumed. Hot tub in pool area was broken ice cold. Walking down the hall heard dogs barking people having relations. Otherwise......it was fine!

I got onto Expedia and the site found us a hotel near where we were presently at. Although the room was on the 4th floor, the hotel did have an elevator. It was also close to an outside door where my husband and I could go and smoke. The in-door pool was the icing on the cake. I had my grandson and great nephew with me so we all really enjoyed unwinding in the pool before beds. Beds were comfortable too."

Rooms were pretty dirty and things seemed outdated. We used the pool and the staff gave my wife a hard time asking for 5 pool towels. If we were rude people, we would have told them off, but we are sometimes overly considerate. This is our chance to tell everyone what we think now. They allow pets here and so things just seemed on the dirty side. Hotel staff, as I indicated, were borderline rude. They were busy when we got there, but no reason to roll your eyes at us. Seriously I wonder what happened to Southern Hospitality and the customer is always right It's not like we asked for anything out of the ordinary. Consequently, we stayed at the Best Western (Downtown Nashville) on our way back through town: Much cleaner. Much nicer. Updated. Very comfortable beds. Excellent (Continental) breakfast. Friendly staff. We will be staying there next time for sure. A little more, but worth it."

It seemed like they only cleaned the areas they could reach with a vacuum. They didn't bother to move any furniture or use any tools to get the crevices. That being said my husband and I felt safe and our 45 lb dog got to stay for free. Check in and check out were a breeze. Breakfast was decent. Pool was not clean, but hot tub was excellent. Elevator seemed a bit old and used but it got us to our room. Not the caliber of hotel I am used to, but hey my fur baby got to stay for free which was really nice. I will definitely use a LaQuinta again when traveling with her. But I would not stay there if I was flying solo."

That said, the fire alarm went off due to a firecracker set off by someone on the upper floors and we all had to evacuate. All of that is procedural and that's fine, but the front desk personnel never left the desk and then when we politely asked if we could go back inside we were met with an employee who was neither willing to explain what was going on nor nice about addressing us. She stood in front of the doors like a guard dog, talking to us like we were all unruly children (though no one was crowding the door, not following protocol, or otherwise giving the staff reason to be that stern). It was very clear that there was no emergency. The hotel was understaffed, which is why I think the staff morale seemed low--it was a holiday weekend, so I wonder about their willingness to be there. I had to literally search for an employee when it was time to check out the front desk personnel was actually in the back washing dishes from breakfast at check-out time. The only thing I really care about in a hotel breakfast is coffee, and they didn't even have real coffee. It was a NesCafe machine, and it wasn't working properly when I was there--very disappointing. Overall, it was a decent stay. My main issue was with staff, but they were dealing with a lot on the holiday weekend and I don't think there was enough staff there. I typically think more highly of La Quinta Inns, but this was just OK."

At night parking lot was full, the night hotel person offered Her space (nice) but we finally found someone leaving. I will say a lot of construction people stayed here, unfortunately they left mud on elevators and Stairs.

The room (a King bed) was spacious and the window opened - I often find it pleasant to have a little fresh air in my hotel room, so really appreciate when the windows aren't sealed up. There were definite signs of wear - walking patterns in carpets, chinks in the paint, etc. The carpets were clean though, and the chinks were visible through new paint - not untended at all. The only thing I didn't like about the room is the bathroom layout - the room door entered into the sink area, and the toilet/shower were across the entry hall of the room. Awkward . . ."

The only thing missing was a fridge. we did not ask but I think if you are going to pay over 200 per night the room should have all the comforts of home. we will more then likely try more places within that price range to see if we can find anything better.

The prices were decent, not great, and the neighborhood was so so. Some good food in the area, but there's an extremely noisy bar directly next to the hotel. No options for room service, and the pillows were pretty uncomfortable. They do offer one free parking space for your vehicle, which is unusual for San Francisco. All and all, I might stay there again, but there are better options."

This was the perfect location for us! (We could see the Golden Gate Bridge from our room) 313. The hotel was clean and comfortable and very reasonably priced! The staff was friendly, especially Alan and Erwin. The maid service was terrific and the best part for us was the free parking. We used our car a lot!! The 2 biggest negative's were the Wifi. ( it was basically nonexistent) We had to upgrade our plan twice through verizon but ended up with 6 free gigs/mo through a promotion we were told about when we called in route to Yosemite! And the other potential negative was the quality of the windows. There were nights we could hear the wind howling and the noise from the street but I'm not a light sleeper so it didn't bother me. (Just bring ear plugs in case you can't sleep from the outside noise). Oh and if you keep walking up Lombard Street from the hotel (1.5 miles approx.) you'll come across the famous crookedest St on Lombard St. !! It's hilly but worth the challenge! In closing I would stay here again!"

This place isn't a 5 star resort, but if you're looking to come to San Francisco and not just sit in your hotel room, it's a great place to stay! The neighborhood was fun had a ton of great restaurants in the area. It's about 10 min walk to the Golden Gate Bridge... The staff is helpful and kind, the beds are soooooo comfy the room is clean. I read some bad reviews about noise, but honestly we had no problems sleeping any of the 3 nights we were there. We would definitely recommend this hotel to people that aren't looking to stay in their rooms the whole time. We basically dropped out stuff went and explored the city. The only time we came back to the room was to sleep and shower and change. I would say to buy a case of water because they have a vending machine in the hall but it's 2 for one bottle of water."

Over all an okay hotel if you're just looking for some place to shower and sleep. The hotel is a bit out dated but provided us what we needed.

The room was clean and did not smell of air freshner. The location is excellent as it is one block from Chestnut St. where there are lots of restaurants, shopping, ATMs and bars. We had a large van and there was plenty of room to park it. One afternoon the office staff even parked it for us as the parking slot was not available when we checked in. Very nice experience!"

We stayed on a weeknight and the price of hotels in Union Square where I usually stay were twice as high at 450. For 225 a night and free parking (which costs at least 50 a day at hotels like Westin St Francis), we had a really comfortable stay. Marina neighborhood is great for walking.

The beds were extremely uncomfortable and the decor is old...not charming, simply old and worn. On the Saturday night of our stay there was so much noise outside we could hardly sleep. Sunday night was quieter, but we still had a hard time sleeping because we couldn't get comfortable in the beds! The internet was spotty at best. The positives for this hotel are the garage parking which is included with your stay and the location. There are lots of restaurants just a block away, you can easily walk toward the water for a great view of the bridge, Fisherman's Wharf is walkable as is the zig-zag section of Lombard Street...if you are in good shape and enjoy mountain climbing. LOL! The walk isn't actually that hard and it's all part of the San Francisco experience. This hotel could be a gem with some customer service training for the staff, new beds and an updated decor.

The neighborhood street and bar across the street was very noisy Friday and Saturday night. We came to do the Avon 39 walk and had a early wake-up time. The noise went on to at least 3 am.

3986,Sombrero Resort and Marina,Marathon,2016-04-03T00:00:00Z,24.711823,-81.08055,3.0,Overall nice place. I knew there was construction going on but the workers were partying and yelling across the parking lot into the night. There were no outside chairs at my room but I noticed some of the workers had deck furniture . It's a lovely area and I would go again AFTER renovations are done. Room very clean! Tiki bar and pool nice and clean as well. I would not recommend for solo females just because of the number of male construction workers.

We felt safe in our room, even though the window unit air conditioner was so loud you wouldn't have heard the door being knocked down. There was a small TV in the living room only. The couch was stained with what looked to be like bio hazard stains and the carpet was worn out and filthy. The bath room was clean and had a blow dryer.

We were moved from one of the condos to a villa without contacting us. I called a few weeks ahead of our stay to check on the reservation and it was then that I was informed of the change. But managing a wheelchair across a gravel parking area with standing water plus maneuvering on a narrow sidewalk and a big step to get into the villa unit would have been quite difficult. The door stuck and was extremely difficult to open and close. Sometimes we couldn't even get it locked. There was a broken window in the kitchenette, broken blinds, cleanliness issues, only straight hot water in one of the showers...yikes! This place was not as represented, even after talking to a clerk at the front desk. We had to leave due to our concerns of the safety issues but Expedia worked with us and refunded our money.

However, there was no running water in our shower/tub. There was no phone in the room to call the office with, no one in the office after I found the number and called with my cell phone. I never the rain again to walk to the bar, hoping the bar tender could give me a number to call. Thankfully, that's where I found Bill, night security and maintenance. He did his best, but was unable to fix our shower quickly, so he upgraded our room and got us moved right away. Bill saved our trip, and turned a very frustrating day into a great night's sleep"

She was very friendly explained to me the policies and gave me a map and list of near by places to eat and things to see. The hotel looks average from the pictures and I was afraid that for the price, it would be a bad place. But it was very good, maybe the best hotel I had in weeks. Bed was gigantic, and super soft. Bed sheets felt like silk. The bathroom was small. And the room was a weird layout. it was in ground floor and the only door was a glass sliding door. The blinds worked fine but my girlfriend felt a little exposed. The room had a window a/c which worked fine and was placed in the right spot, the whole room was cool and I never felt wind in my face. the pool was refreshing, tiki bar was nice. The hotel was kind of difficult to find, first there is no sing/ I didnt see one, It says Marathon Key but Marathon is long and made of different keys. If you go, Look for the gas station and Publix supermarket, make right turn behind super market. there is a beach a short distance from the hotel, rated as one of the best in the Keys...I didnt get to see it. too bad.

The room was dirty and did not get cleaned appropriately, the beds got made while we were out but that was it. The tub faucet would unscrew when you attempted to use the shower and the tub would fill up as you took a shower. Water pipes broke at some point during our stay and they did not have the courtesy to come and tell us. When we figured this out I went to the front desk to ask for a different room and was told it would be fixed within the hour. Again, no one bothered to tell us when it was fixed. I felt that should have been a common courtesy. Black particles would blow in our room from the swamp cooler. The room was every dirty and although it was close to the beach it was not worth it.

The wi-if didn't reach our room. Luckily I had a hot spot because mt son had to write a college paper. Pretty annoyed that we weren't told that either. However, the rooms were very clean and the beds were the best I have ever slept on in a hotel. They only have 12 rooms open while they remodel the resort. I would have thought that the service would have been better, but it was quiet and very comfortable after the water came back on."
4047,Sombrero Resort and Marina,Marathon,2015-10-17T00:00:00Z,24.711823,-81.08055,2.0,"Although I had read the reviews beforehand, it was one of the few available hotels for a decent price and we had hoped that what others wrote would have been corrected by the time we went to stay at the Sombrero. Unfortunately, mostly everything the other reviews said also applied to our stay. The room was more of a condo, which was nice. It had a fold away couch and a full kitchen with all the appliances and even dishes and pots and pans. All that however did not do us any good if we didn't sleep all night since both a/c units were extremely noisy. We had to turn off the one in the bedroom because we could not sleep, so we were sweating instead. Even if we COULD sleep, we still didn't, since the bed was sunken, the springs were non-existent. Also even though the hotel provided internet, there was no signal strong enough to allow for more than a 30 second connection. They may have other rooms which have a decent bed and quiet a/c units, but we cannot take that chance next time we travel to the Keys."

Centipedes or similar on room floor, small black bugs in the bathroom, and ants in the kitchen. While the staff was extremely rude, including the manager who just walked off, they did clean the room and spray for us. When we wanted to try the wifi, which we were told had been out a few days and did work around the pool, we were given an incorrect passcode. When we asked for help because all but 3 or 4 of the tv stations were pixelating, the call to maintanence was the lady in room xyz is up here complaining about her tv, instead of the guests in room xyz need their to looked at. We were charged at check in, although told we would be charged at check out. We were told we couldn't get a receipt because the computers were down, and couldn't even be told what we were charged. When I complained, the customer service rep turned his head to the side and spoke in baby talk...I'm so sorry, It's not my fault. Overall, I would avoid this hotel. For the money, there are surrounding hotels that aren't filthy. Had we not insisted it been recleaned and bug sprayed, we would have been expected to sleep in that!"

This hotel has obviously had a recent renovation and upgrade. Rooms were large, clean, comfortable. Bathrooms well appointed modern and clean. Despite being near the airport and major roads, the rooms were very quiet. Easy access from I-84 and I-87. This hotel has been underrated. Perhaps most pf the ratings preceded the renovation. NOTE: For handicap accessibility,request a first floor room. No elevator, but first floor corridor is accessible from the lobby, no steps. NOTE 2: Restaurant next door is separate from hotel. Not recommended."

While conveniently located off the Interstate it was sub-sub-par in quality. The carpet and bedspread were soiled and dirty - we left our shoes on - the ice bucket had not been emptied or cleaned and had bugs in it. And, the bathtub was totally unappealing with a plastic mat glued on the tub floor - we didn't shower or bathe. Needless to say we would never choose to stay here again."

Locking key door in back parking area of hotel sometime was working, most times bypassed allowing ANYONE inside. Next to (maybe 50 yards) MAJOR expressway (TRUCKS THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT).

Front desk lady was friendly, but couldn't check anybody in at first- took about 30 minutes for her to get the computer working. The price was reasonable, so I tempered my expectations. Outwardly, the hotel appeared clean decently maintained however, once we entered the room there was an unpleasant odor and a closer look showed the room could have been a bit cleaner. For the price I was satisfied however."

I looked for the closest hotel with the highest rating per guest. This is what I found. I found out while staying in Newburgh it has a very high murder rate, in the Nation! We were right by the freeway and not residential around us so I did feel safe. The room was one of the quietest I have ever stayed in. I could not even hear when Mom took a shower but there was the constant elevated interstate noise, but the room was clean even through there was huge stains on the bedspreads. The cleaning staff were friendly, the handyman who replaced the broken hairdryer was friendly, the rest were either rude or did not speak. The hotel is old, hallways still smell of smoke, rugs old, but they are working on maintaining it. Breakfast was the worst I have ever experienced. Who does not have toast? They only had cereal, bagged bagels and English muffins, some juice and alternated with bagged Danish or Belgian waffles. Our reservation was a mess when we arrived. It ended up with the receptionist being rude to the Hotel.com rep. In the end we got our room, reasonably priced during the week but graduation weekend it was doubled. This is also a ways to drive to West Point. I received no points from my family for booking this hotel."

We were able to find a maintenance man and he came in, then had to leave to find an extension cord to plug in the light!!! Only one outlet in the room!!!! Beds should have been replaced years ago, they were so uncomfortable and the mattresses sagged so you were sleeping in a hole! Tub was from the 70's and the years have not been kind to it!! Even the new shower curtain could not disguise what was going on in there!! Honestly, we should have driven home, but decided to stay the night since it was late and there we no other hotel rooms available in the area do to Parent's weekend at the local colleges and a big rival football game. The Continental Breakfast was a joke, and by this time, we just laughed and got the hell out of there!!!

They are updating the hotel though never heard any noises from that or any other room. They were booked yet it was so very quiet. Fantastic size King size bed with a pull out couch, table, Samsung TV, Tall Refrigerator and microwave. I loved the 2 sinks idea and made it very convenient for me and my friends to stay there. Next year we plan on having another get together and I will be staying at that hotel!"

I was very unhappy with the condition of the hotel and the rooms. I did better off sleeping in my car. The only reason why I stayed was because of a funeral for my brother that passed. I will not be visiting this location ever again. This must really be a joke on websites stating the good reviews at this hotel. Just terrible and it will not be recommended to anyone I know that is for sure.

Okay for one person, but I had to climb up out of it each morning. If there was more than one person, they would both have to be very comfortable with being trapped in the middle of the bed. No hotel charging anything should have a bed in this poor condition, although, in my case, it worked out all right. Maybe they only give this room to single people."

We stayed in a ground floor room and its patio door was permanently locked by a nail - it felt so not safe!!! Bathroom walls were broken. Stained and gross carpet. Stained bed sheets. Staff were so unfriendly. Horrible breakfast. I'll never recommend this hotel to anyone.
4192,Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Newburgh,2014-01-20T00:00:00Z,41.505388,-74.073291,2.0,Just another worn out property purchased by a buzzard to extract whatever profit is still possible.Leaky faucets.Poor drains.Caved bed.Exposed wiring in broken lamp.Tired furniture.Ancient TV with purple haze.Sad . . . almost as sad as Chris Christie ; )

Bagels, muffins, DIY waffles. Only negative were the comfortability of the bed mattresses. A bit hard. And the pillows were fairly poor also. However at price point id still recomend staying here."

Our room smelled horrible and the carpets were so filthy we were afraid to take off our shoes. The blankets and sheets had stains and were worn to the point of being see thru in places. In addition, the ceiling panels were falling in and the bathroom vent fan was hanging from the ceiling and didn't run. The shower allowed the temperature to go well above 140 degrees according to the controls and my son almost melted his skin off accidentally. The television was an old Mitsubishi console with white fuzz. Because we got in so late, there were no other rooms to switch to. I truly don't know how this place stays in business. Disgusting."

Reservation was efficient, check in staff were very helpful and friendly. Room was ok clean, but did smell a bit. Rooms are run down. Door to outside opens which is great but does not lock properly and relies on a pole behind the door to prevent the sliding door from being moved.... More"

Only complaint is that the entry to the stairs and hallway smelled quite strong of mustiness trying to be covered up with chemicals. Not a good mix. Plenty of food choices in area. Neptune Diner is minutes away and was delicious!

The room we had was reasonably comfortable.  The hotel has two floors but no elevator, and one must navigate stairs to enter the first floor from the most convenient entrances.  The breakfast had very few choices, and no healthy options.  The hallways are very long and somewhat dingy.  Overall, it is not the worst possible experience, but it is not one I would recommend for most people."

Bathroom sink was clogged, told front desk in the morning, fixed by the time I returned.  Bed - uncomfortable as hell.  Sheets/blankets were far too thin, mattress was hard as a rock.  Curtains were blackout with no sheers, so you could never open your windows without the people from across the way seeing everything you were doing.  No plugs nearby to charge near bed, had to unplug lamp.  No elevator to second floor. (Didn't really matter to me) Continental breakfast was total crap.  It's a place to stay cheaply."

The bathroom could have used a slight upgrade..shower curtain was damaged and there was a little mold around the tub.

I was a little nervous, having read some other reviews, but we took a shot. Yes, the hallways had the odor of cigarette smoke, but the room did not. The bedding was clean and fresh, and the room itself was very clean. We had asked for a cot, and when we arrived to check in it was already in the room. The staff was extremely friendly and accommodating, even after check-out, when I remembered that I had forgotten something and had to get back into the room. The free breakfast was so-so, but coffee was good. They have a microwave and fridge in the room, so if you have doubts it's easy to bring your own. For the price, it was a very pleasant stay."

My band mates and I drove 20 hours straight, walk into the hotel, and when I started the check in process he clerk said I don't want any problems. He also mentioned not wanting to have to call the police and basically implied that he didn't want us there. We were polite, and respectful the whole time. When it was time for the continental breakfast, there were no tables available, so we sat on the the couch that was 4 feet from the juice machine, and we were told to go find a table. The safe in the room was locked with the door open so we couldn't store our cash in there. We left for NYC, came back, and my buddy's bag was rummaged through. He always leaves his orange hunting knife on top of his clothes, but it was under his sweatshirt and a few other things when we got back. The screen onthe door to get on the patio was ripped from the bottom and up the side. The curtain was detached from the stick that you use to open and close them. I was not impressed with the stay. Not worth 120 a night."

Hotel was dingy, worn down, strange smell as soon as you walked in.  The room was so dim and when we went to turn the lights on, nothing worked.  We were able to find a maintenance man and he came in, then had to leave to find an extension cord to plug in the light!!!  Only one outlet in the room!!!!  Beds should have been replaced years ago, they were so uncomfortable and the mattresses sagged so you were sleeping in a hole!  Tub was from the 70's and the years have not been kind to it!!  Even the new shower curtain could not disguise what was going on in there!!  Honestly, we should have driven home, but decided to stay the night since it was late and there we no other hotel rooms available in the area do to Parent's weekend at the local colleges and a big rival football game.  The ""Continental Breakfast"" was a joke, and by this time, we just laughed and got the hell out of there!!!  Like I said, if this is what to expect from Expedia, I will never use them again, and I most certainly will never stay at the Howard Johnson Hotel again...."

4248,Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Newburgh,2014-08-19T00:00:00Z,41.505388,-74.073291,2.0,"It was fine, room was reasonably clean, beds were comfortable. We had a microwave and a coffee maker. We were there to get an early start on a triathlon the following day, so we were really not looking for anything beyond a reasonably clean place to crash. The staff were very nice, for a budget Hotel that caters to folks not concerned with amenities, it was fine and I would stay again."

4251,Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Newburgh,2014-12-02T00:00:00Z,41.505388,-74.073291,3.0,"For an inexpensive hotel, it was fine. Rooms were reasonably clean although there were cigarette burn holes in the comforter. The blankets were really thin so I recommend asking for an extra one. But for the price- which is one of the cheapest in the area- it was fine."
4252,Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Newburgh,2015-08-09T00:00:00Z,41.505388,-74.073291,4.0,At first sight was a little taken aback as it looked like it was abandoned. After checking in we discovered that it was very clean and the room was very clean and spacious. Also very quite. The hotel staff was very helpful and nice
4253,Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Newburgh,2015-10-02T00:00:00Z,41.505388,-74.073291,4.0,"I was late in looking for a hotel near my son's college for family weekend, so my search was narrowed down to about 8 hotels a half an hour away.  I read the reviews and this seemed to receive the best comments.  We found the hotel to be clean and fine for our purposes, which was basically somewhere to watch tv after dinner and go to sleep. The bathroom was somewhat outdated but clean. The front office staff was great- the first night we were greeted warmly by the young woman, and my checkout was handled efficiently by the gentleman at the desk the next morning.  There were a number of restaurants and stores nearby for somewhere to walk around after dinner.  We even decided that we would probably stay at this hotel the next time because we were able to save so much more money than if we had stayed at an overpriced motel closer to the college!"
4254,Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Newburgh,2016-04-17T00:00:00Z,41.505388,-74.073291,4.0,It was your basic motel.  Clean overall with most things updated.  It's clearly an old Hojos which has been renovated so is it perfect?  No.  Is it better than the average motel?  Yup.  Worth the money.  Staff was very nice or the person who was there the night I arrived.
4255,Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Newburgh,2016-03-12T00:00:00Z,41.505388,-74.073291,3.0,It is not an expensive place to stay for the night while away for work. Easy to miss the place at night since the big sign in front was not lit.

4264,Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Newburgh,2016-08-15T00:00:00Z,41.505388,-74.073291,3.0,"We made late reservations through hotels.com and arrived 30 minutes later.  After checking in, we took our bags to our room only to discover that it had a strong cigarette odor, even though it was clearly marked as a no smoking room.  The desk clerk made a quick change and we were off to another room, which smelled much better.The bed was comfortable and the climate control worked well.  Breakfast was sufficient, including cereal, bagels and English muffins, and a waffle maker.While we weren't there long enough to check out the other amenities, it was good for a road trip stop."
4265,Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Newburgh,2015-06-02T00:00:00Z,41.505388,-74.073291,2.0,"Staff were nice and helpful, room was not super clean. No elevator, and our room was on the second floor. Bed sagged in the middle, causing my wife and I to constantly roll to the middle. The sewer backed up into our toilet causing raw sewage to go on bathroom floor. Hotel did send up maintence promptly. Were gone all day, when we returned the problem was fixed but the room still smelled, so they gave us a new one. In a pinch I suppose it's ok, the staff were good at least, but I'll prob never use them again."
4266,Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Newburgh,2014-06-16T00:00:00Z,41.505388,-74.073291,2.0,no refrigerator in the room. the entire property smelled like cigarettes.

4268,Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Newburgh,2015-07-26T00:00:00Z,41.505388,-74.073291,4.0,Une nuit arriver a 11:00 le soir tres bien servi et tres bon service !!
4269,Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Newburgh,2016-05-28T00:00:00Z,41.505388,-74.073291,2.0,"The hallways were dingy and smelled. The room was dirty. The windows were dirty. There were cobwebs near the heater/ac. The towel rack was missing a screw and one corner was completely detached from the wall. Some of the lights did not work. The toilet clogged because of paper. The manager that night said there was not staff available to help and gave us a plunger so we could take care of it ourselves. There were mosquitoes and and other insects all over the hallways and near the ice machine. We were glad we were staying only for one night. It's a low-budget hotel and I did not expect much in terms of comfort and aesthetics. However, cleanliness and customer service are a must. I will not be staying at any Howard Johnsons in the future."
4270,Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Newburgh,2015-10-09T00:00:00Z,41.505388,-74.073291,3.0,The hotel is located right off of Interstate 84. There are plenty of restaurants near the hotel and it was close to West Point.

4272,Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Newburgh,2015-08-02T00:00:00Z,41.505388,-74.073291,3.0,"I've stayed at a lot of hotels, some were real dumps (I won't tell you how bad, just say blood was found). Anyway, this place was little outdated, but was very clean. The king bed was comfortable and breakfast was very good. The staff wasn't the friendliest, but I'd rather have good food. Also, it is not located in a bad part of town, just a little noise from traffic. I would highly recommend if you get good price."
4273,Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Newburgh,2016-07-31T00:00:00Z,41.505388,-74.073291,3.0,Kind of low rent - you get what you pay for.
4274,Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Newburgh,2016-06-17T00:00:00Z,41.505388,-74.073291,2.0,"The back door to the parking lot was left unlocked at night so that anyone could walk in. Since my room was next to the door and the hotel is not in the best location, I didn't feel safe. Also, it doesn't have an elevator, so second floor access with bags was difficult."
4275,Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Newburgh,2015-07-21T00:00:00Z,41.505388,-74.073291,1.0,"First I was uncomfortable with lady at front desk making copies of my ID and credit card, walked into room and the carpet was old smelly and a huge iron print mark burn in the carpet, after settling in I turned on television realized that remote required to batteries later on went to use bathroom will forward pictures do you may review and I will wait for your opinion."
4276,Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Newburgh,2016-05-06T00:00:00Z,41.505388,-74.073291,1.0,"The entire facility is extremely run down and in desperate need of updating from the ground up. The hallways are very poorly lit and dirty. The rooms reek of cigarettes (tobacco and otherwise), the heating and cooling units don't work and some of the doors look like they've been kicked in or pried open. The TV only had one channel and the wifi is painfully slow. The only reason I stayed after seeing the room was I was tired and didn't feel like finding another hotel last minute. Definitely not worth any price to stay here."
4277,Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Newburgh,2014-09-22T00:00:00Z,41.505388,-74.073291,3.0,"Most aspects were fine, but the carpeting in our room desperately needed to be ripped out & changed. It had a perfect impression of an iron in it & the edges were full of dust, etc., indicating it had not been vacuumed thoroughly for some time."

(One staff member was good though.) From what I could see, the room-cleaning staff does the best they can with what they have. The rate charged for the room was attractive but the savings comes at a different cost. This hotel really ""needs that special something."""
4285,Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Newburgh,2014-01-14T00:00:00Z,41.505388,-74.073291,2.0,"bed was very uncomfortable and when I took down the sheets there was food crumbs on top of the sheet, So I'm guessing who ever made the bed last enjoyed their snack on the bed and then made it. Also one of the sheets was full of holes."

My room was non smoking, I think that just for the 3 nights I was there.  Areas of no paint on the bathroom walls, holes in the wall, globs of yellow ancient chalking around the toilet bottom.  The shower leaked, drip, drip, drip.  No maid service my second night.  A sticker on the bathroom door from a previous guest.  I woke up in the middle of the night all stuffed up from the noxious air.  I had to kept the air conditioning on all night.  There was a thick layer of dust on the tv console.  The facecloth was like sandpaper.  The towels didn't absorb water...I don't know what they were made of.  If I had paid forty a night I would expect what I got.  This is a one star folks!"
4287,Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Newburgh,2016-07-20T00:00:00Z,41.505388,-74.073291,3.0,"I was very disappointed in the fact that I booked this hotel mainly for a continental breakfast and a pool for my grandchildren. When traveling 8 hours I wanted them to be able to relax and enjoy the pool - only to get there and the pool was closed and not working. If that was on the description I would not have booked it - I would have gone somewhere else. Booking information should be updated periodically - especially during the summer hours when young children are traveling, Then I come home and see that the hotel tried to take away my reward point stating that we cancelled the reservation and took away my points. I called the customer service line for hotels.com and the person working called and verified with the hotel that we did stay there. Hotels.com personnel were very helpful."

Upon arrival, the toilet had been used and not completely flushed. The bathroom was old and badly in need of repair. The second day ( Had I not been locked into Expedia, there wouldn't have been a second day!!!!) there was garbage by the garbage can that hadn't been removed. The entire room felt dirty. I will never stay at another Howard Johnson or use Expedia again. This experience was horrible."
4291,Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Newburgh,2015-04-06T00:00:00Z,41.505388,-74.073291,4.0,"TV's are quite old and kind of unbearable to watch. The beds are not the softest and I had trouble sleeping through the night as a side sleeper. The hotel certainly does not look like the pictures provided. The tennis court is dilapidated and growing trees but overall the room was exactly what I expected for the price.  The breakfast was bearable as juices were provided (more fruit flavored sugar concoctions- in fact i am 99% certain the orange juice was strongly mixed tang), a waffle maker, coffee, and prepackaged pastries like danishes got the job done for me."
4292,Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Newburgh,2015-10-25T00:00:00Z,41.505388,-74.073291,2.0,"Did the job. I slept well enough & ate a good breakfast. Front desk lady was friendly, but couldn't check anybody in at first- took about 30 minutes for her to get the computer working. The price was reasonable, so I tempered my expectations. Outwardly, the hotel appeared clean & decently maintained however, once we entered the room there was an unpleasant odor and a closer look showed the room could have been a bit cleaner. For the price I was satisfied however."

Signs in the lobby about cash transactions and age restrictions made the hotel seem a little dicey. Finally, there was a skunk at the front door and a rat at the back. The staff member said ""I can't believe we don't have the phone number for Animal Control with all of the wild dogs and cats out back"". Thankfully, I was told I would not be charged. I SLEPT IN MY VEHICLE IN A REST STOP. Felt safer in a rest stop on Interstate 87 than I did any where near that hotel."

First floor rooms have sliding glass doors that open to the parking lot. I didn't feel very safe at all. The room had a funky odor and I just didn't have a comfortable feeling in my surroundings. With the exception of the bathroom, it was difficult to find a plug to charge electronic devices. Also the table and chairs were very crammed in the room. I am a small person and had a very difficult time sitting at the table and trying to do work at the table.  I wouldn't have stayed here based on previous comments, but I needed a room for one night and this was about all that was available. I honestly was tempted to sleep in my car."

It backs up to highway 87 and the trucks can be heard through the night in the rooms facing the highway which we were in. The doors need to be replaced through out the hotel, wiring runs haphazardly over the roofs, and the bathtub had cracks from old age. No refrigerators in the rooms which we missed. The hotel is being repainted and seems to be a work in motion. Morning breakfast was limited, no yogurt."

First of all the man at the front desk was extremely rude to me and my friend. Once we got our room we heard someone outside our door about an hour later I looked the peep hole and the man from the front desk was looking inside our peep hole!! I was so freaked out I kept checking it all night I was even too scared to leave through the front door the next day. I originally planned to stay 2 nights but was so disgusted that I booked a different hotel the next night! Do not stay there especially if you're a young female!

I was in town for a funeral Sunday and Monday. Saturday night I was awaken at 2:30 am by a wedding party that booked rooms side by side my room while they were drinking and talking loudly in the hallwaymoutside my room door, at least a dozen of them. I called the front desk for someone to tell them to go to their rooms, nothing happened , so after 30 minutes I got up and asked them please to keep it down. Old hotel, not much of a continental breakfast, old sheets and bedding, stiff mattresses, paid less from other motels and got better in past, but most places in area are over $100 a night, I booked for 4 night, better to pay over a $100 a night a get a quieter more comfortable bed."

4312,Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Newburgh,2014-08-17T00:00:00Z,41.505388,-74.073291,4.0,"We had drove by the hotel our first try finding the hotel as the sign was partially hidden by a tree. We called the number supplied for the hotel,  was given directions from where we were. We paid closer attention second drive through, noticing the sign this time.  Checking in was pleasant and was given directions on where we could park and which door was best to enter to get to our room. The room was set up in a pleasant manor, with a king size bed. The continental breakfast was very good, with cereal, muffins, waffles, coffie, juice, bagels, and fruit available."

Needs updating like doors on rooms and bath fixtures. Saw a beaver or possum type animal outside going under cement slab outside glass patio doors during early daylight evening hours.

There was an iron left on the floor too long that held melted the carpet and was never fixed haha. But worse off it felt unclean. The bed was itchy and my travel buddy and I woke up with little red bumps and bites on our bodies. We suspect it was bed bugs, but didn't decide to stay around to find out. Checked out of there. Do not recommend at all. You can do better. Like sleeping in your car or under a tree."

4318,Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Newburgh,2016-05-06T00:00:00Z,41.505388,-74.073291,1.0,"The entire facility is extremely run down and in desperate need of updating from the ground up. The hallways are very poorly lit and dirty. The rooms reek of cigarettes (tobacco and otherwise), the heating and cooling units don't work and some of the doors look like they've been kicked in or pried open. The TV only had one channel and the wifi is painfully slow. The only reason I stayed after seeing the room was I was tired and didn't feel like finding another hotel last minute. Definitely not worth any price to stay here."

4321,Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Newburgh,2015-08-03T00:00:00Z,41.505388,-74.073291,4.0,We stopped off here on a long journey to North Carolina. The room was clean and had everything we needed.
4322,Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Newburgh,2016-05-29T00:00:00Z,41.505388,-74.073291,4.0,We only stayed one night and the room was clean and comfortable. Howard Johnson is the only hotel chain (and we have stayed in many other hotels)that allows their guests to open the room window or patio doors. I wish the sliding door of our room would have been in its frame and not hanging away from the frame so we could have enjoyed fresh air in our room. It was a lovely night to have the door open.
4323,Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Newburgh,2014-07-08T00:00:00Z,41.505388,-74.073291,1.0,"I've stayed in this hotel twice before with no issues. However, this time when we checked in our room it had a pungent smell.. As of they were trying to mask the smell. There were bugs crawling on the table, I awoke one morning to a huge spider on my pillow looking at me and lastly.. The bathroom had tiny hairs on floor and shower wall. Was truely disgusted with my stay!"

4325,Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Newburgh,2016-06-18T00:00:00Z,41.505388,-74.073291,2.0,"The back door to the parking lot was left unlocked at night so that anyone could walk in. Since my room was next to the door and the hotel is not in the best location, I didn't feel safe. Also, it doesn't have an elevator, so second floor access with bags was difficult."
4326,Howard Johnson Inn - Newburgh,Newburgh,2016-06-07T00:00:00Z,41.505388,-74.073291,2.0,"The hallways were dingy and smelled.  The room was dirty.  The windows were dirty.  There were cobwebs near the heater/ac.  The towel rack was missing a screw and one corner was completely detached from the wall.  Some of the lights did not work.  The toilet clogged because of paper.  The manager that night said there was not staff available to help and gave us a plunger so we could take care of it ourselves.  There were mosquitoes and and other insects all over the hallways and near the ice machine.  We were glad we were staying only for one night. It's a low-budget hotel and I did not expect much in terms of comfort and aesthetics.  However, cleanliness and customer service are a must.  I will not be staying at any Howard Johnsons in the future."

The furniture was very outdated and uncomfortable, the sliding glass door was held locked by a bar instead of fixing the door. We were asked to leave our table at breakfast before we were done eating because there were only six tables to accommodate all their guests. We had been sitting there for only 15 minutes.  When I explained I wasn't finished the woman became very rude and snapped at me to finish. Really????"

I'm an fully aware that it's not the 4 seasons, but this hotel is a bit pricy for its condition.  Its clean but past its prime, needs an upgrade, fresh coat of paint; it serves it purpose, but I thought should be cheaper.  Then again, seems par for the course in that area."

There were only 2 double beds and no leaving room, no extra sofa for my child. we had to re-allocate to a different hotel after midnight! In the pictures I could see the leaving room and the extra sofa... far from reality... The first receptionist sent me to talk with Expedia were I made the reservation... imagine, it was 23:30, with 3 kids during a very late check-in after I verified late check-in and a room for 5 in the phone earlier. disappointment."

I read the reviews and this seemed to receive the best comments. We found the hotel to be clean and fine for our purposes, which was basically somewhere to watch tv after dinner and go to sleep. The bathroom was somewhat outdated but clean. The front office staff was great- the first night we were greeted warmly by the young woman, and my checkout was handled efficiently by the gentleman at the desk the next morning. There were a number of restaurants and stores nearby for somewhere to walk around after dinner. We even decided that we would probably stay at this hotel the next time because we were able to save so much more money than if we had stayed at an overpriced motel closer to the college!"

Air leaks around the sliding glass door, which I did not dare try and open.

We came to do visit family and spend most of our time in NYC. It was only an hour from the city. We checked in late our first night and the women at the desk was extremely friendly.. I believe her name started with an S or something. Our stay was great. We enjoyed our cozy room. Everything worked fine. Everything was decently clean and comfortable. My only complaint was a few of the housekeepers were very rude and acted annoyed if we were still in our room when them came to clean and asked to come a bit later. As well as a few of the mornings when we went to enjoy the free breakfast, some housekeepers sat and watched what we did and what we ate and how much we took. I was even told that I took ""too many plates"" when I actually needed them since I was bringing food back for my daughter and fianc��e. And while we ate I was stared at and talked about. Another quick thing was they don't have any working cribs for guests who need them which definitely caused issues when it came to sleeping at night. But other than that everything was great."

Booking information should be updated periodically - especially during the summer hours when young children are traveling,Then I come home and see that the hotel tried to take away my reward point stating that we cancelled the reservation and took away my points.  I called the customer service line for hotels.com and the person working called and verified with the hotel that we did stay there.  Hotels.com personnel were very helpful."

Rooms were large, clean, comfortable. Bathrooms well appointed modern and clean. Despite being near the airport and major roads, the rooms were very quiet. Easy access from I-84 and I-87. This hotel has been underrated. Perhaps most pf the ratings preceded the renovation. NOTE: For handicap accessibility,request a first floor room.

In addition, the ceiling panels were falling in and the bathroom vent fan was hanging from the ceiling and didn't run. The shower allowed the temperature to go well above 140 degrees according to the controls and my son almost melted his skin off accidentally. The television was an old Mitsubishi console with white fuzz. Because we got in so late, there were no other rooms to switch to. I truly don't know how this place stays in business. Disgusting."

When it was time for the continental breakfast, there were no tables available, so we sat on the the couch that was 4 feet from the juice machine, and we were told to go find a table. The safe in the room was locked with the door open so we couldn't store our cash in there. We left for NYC, came back, and my buddy's bag was rummaged through. He always leaves his orange hunting knife on top of his clothes, but it was under his sweatshirt and a few other things when we got back.

Howard Johnson is the only hotel chain (and we have stayed in many other hotels)that allows their guests to open the room window or patio doors.  I wish the sliding door of our room would have been in its frame and not hanging away from the frame so we could have enjoyed fresh air in our room. It was a lovely night to have the door open.

I'm an fully aware that it's not the 4 seasons, but this hotel is a bit pricy for its condition. Its clean but past its prime, needs an upgrade, fresh coat of paint it serves it purpose, but I thought should be cheaper. Then again, seems par for the course in that area."

We came to do visit family and spend most of our time in NYC. It was only an hour from the city. We checked in late our first night and the women at the desk was extremely friendly.. I believe her name started with an S or something. Our stay was great. We enjoyed our cozy room. Everything worked fine. Everything was decently clean and comfortable. My only complaint was a few of the housekeepers were very rude and acted annoyed if we were still in our room when them came to clean and asked to come a bit later. As well as a few of the mornings when we went to enjoy the free breakfast, some housekeepers sat and watched what we did and what we ate and how much we took. I was even told that I took ""too many plates"" when I actually needed them since I was bringing food back for my daughter and fiancée. And while we ate I was stared at and talked about. Another quick thing was they don't have any working cribs for guests who need them which definitely caused issues when it came to sleeping at night. But other than that everything was great."

The old mattress you can see springs and ridges on the bed. We asked to transfer to another room and the mattress there was a little better not great. We had to call housekeeping for the maid to clean the tub (scrub) it was still very dirty from the other clients that stayed before us. The toilet handle disconnected and broke. We had to call for a plumber to come fix the toilet. The next day, the maid did not clean the bathroom well. The mirror still had water spots, the swab I dropped onto the floor was not sweep or picked up. My friend got fleas bites on her legs from her bed. We had to ask for extra bed sheets to cover the mattress. The highlight at Harrah's is the buffet restaurant. The food was very good. By the way, the front desk kept saying since you booked through a third party.. there's nothing more we can do. Treated us pretty badly."

The room was dusty on the furniture as well as the vents, our room attendants did not clean or make up our room, our blankets were pulled up and the pillows were thrown on the bed. At the pool towels were not available and the attendant at the time said that we could have only one towel then closed up the area and disappeared.

Valet parking is very unorganized causing congestion and long wait times coming and going. Line at check-in at 3 pm was horribly long, so left to get dinner. Line still long when we got back 2 hours later. Then there were ridiculously long lines the entire time for elevators in Tower 3. We actually found and used the service elevator after the first day. Both swimming pools and beach were closed first day because of winds, which were maybe 10 miles an hour. Room smelled like a sewer entire visit, and bathroom tiles/shower had mold and stains. Breakfast at the buffet was the only highlight of the visit."

The check in process was antiquated and took forever. Then they sprang the surprise: a 75 per room per night security deposit. We had 2 rooms and had booked 3 nights. Translation: we left the front desk 450 lighter than we arrived. The elevators were scary and the line to board the elevator was often 50 or more people. I ended up taking the stairs (to the 7th floor) several times to avoid the line for the elevators. The staff were lackluster at best, often sullen and dismissive. The casino was dull and dated. There were lots of other nasty surprises too numerous to list here. The ONLY redeeming quality was Guy Fieri's restaurant, El Burro Borracho (Spanish for the drunken donkey). We spent most of our time in Laughlin at other casinos and had a great time there. We were drawn in by the low price but after adding in the almost 12 nightly resort fee and the stifling security deposit, it was no bargain. Do yourself a favor and avoid this place!"

No umbrellas/coolers at the beachonly foam coolers purchased from their gift shop allowed. They have umbrella spots you can use, unless someone rented the spot already. There is no other shade other than those area, so rent or get there early. It's about 400 to rent a jetski for the day. But take a 10 minute drive over the bridge to the other side of the river, entire day Jet Ski rental runs about 130. I guess the extra price is the convenience of not having to drive 10 minutes away. Pool area is basic and they need to put bathrooms in the pool area and closer to the beach area. Food was pricey based on quality. Not many healthy choices. When you get tired of eating greasy heavy food, your only choice is a fruit plate. I ordered a chicken caesar salad to keep it light and it was heavy too. You can order food directly on the beach. There was a server named Anthony down there and his awesome service made up for the not so great food. Room view was nice, ac worked great, and bathroom was clean. Room was outdated but seemed clean. There isn't anything exciting or praise worthy about the room itself, its about what you get at a Motel 6. My daughter slept in one of the beds in our room was attacked by bed bugs. Poor baby had a massive amount of bites up both sides of her stomach. On both her sides it went from her hip up to her armpit. I definitely wasn't happy about this and wont be returning."

Imagine my surprise when they charged my credit card 225 for service deposit! 75 per day day of my stay. Service I guess they anticipated me to use! Then to beat it all service dogs all over the place! In the restaurant! In the casino! No wonder the room carpet is all dirty!! Won't be staying here again.

AWFUL ROOM!! 1) There was a dead roach in the middle of the room. 2) The linen was tattered and had black smudge marks/stains. 3) THE SMELL OF THE ROOM WAS ATROCIOUS!! 4) Parking for the family (north tower) is despicable at best. 5) Front desk staff was nice and tolerable of my antsy, road trip toddler. I would ONLY stay here if I was local and wanted to use the beach."

The North tower elevators seem to have a perpetual line on the weekends so be patient. Some of the floors / rooms are showing their age but as long as your not expecting 5 star conditions you should be okay. One reason we don't stay here often is that there is limited, on property parking for trailers. They do have overflow parking across the street but it's a bit of a walk and worry about security of the lot."

We expected it to be nice like Harrah's Atlantic City, but this place was terrible. The rooms (2) were dirty with broken plumbing in one. The carpets were threadbare and apparently held together by a cement like mix of dirt and mystery spills. The only positives were the receptionist and the location.

They only had 3 employees working the desk. We asked for connecting rooms but they were not given since per Harrahs We booked through hotels.com and what they advertise is false We didnt get the rooms we wanted was suposed to get 2 queens but got 2 fulls. The kids pool is always full. We only stayed at the resort to sleep at night. There is a 75 per day per room refundable fee that you will have to pay when you arrive. Over all it was ok. House keeping forgot to give us a shower curtain and they quickly responded. Over all would stay here again just to sleep. Oh and elvators on the north tower take forever.

It wasn't too crowded, but it was a very hot day. The pools were very crowded to the point that swimming in them wasn't enjoyable. The casino is nice and spacious. The property offers quite a few restaurant options and a large gift shop / convenience store. The outside / entrance to the hotel casino could use a little extra care. It's starting to show the first signs of being neglecte and outdated. The river side of the hotel is kept up much better. The buffet is a good price and the food was okay for the money. Some of the items like the salmon and roast beef were way over cooked . The staff was friendly except for a man at the rewards counter who didn't give us all the information we needed about our rewards cards and had an attitude like we were bothering him. Everyone else made up for his poor service. Half the casino is non smoking which is nice too. Over all Id go back for a quick getaway."

Very rotten smell. So we called and asked to be moved the lady on the phone said they were sold out and offered to have someone come spray the room. Is that a joke! That's masking the smell not getting rid of it. Finally we moved to a different room. The room smelled fine but the tv didn't work. My fianc called front desk, after about 10 minutes someone picked up and told him to turn to a specific channel (48) and leave it on there for a while then it should work. How does that even make sense I have to idea. But we did it. Of course it didn't work. So he called no one picked up. So we stopped by the front desk on our way to dinner and they said they would send someone to fix it. Hours later we got back to the room and it still wasn't fixed. Because of the lack of customer service and poor rooms we won't stay here again."

Negatives: No a/c in the elevators and each tower only has one and we were on the 17th floor that stops almost every floor...not good when it's 115 degrees. We have watercrafts and there is very little parking...sometimes had to wait till people left to park. Room A/C worked but not well. The price of 39 a night seemed good but once you get home they add another 11 resort fee that wasn't disclosed. Lastly, we ordered a coffee maker that was great for the first day but not refilled after that. We even called down to get more coffee three times and it never came so I finally walked down and bought some at the Starbucks. The last day when I called three times and finally went to get my own, I informed them it had been a few hours and I got my own so it would be great to take the coffee maker off our bill. They only took the last day off, even though we only had coffee one day."

We didn't like the fact that the casino blocked our cell signal. Our family was unable to communicate with each other by text. Eventhough we stayed in the family tower, the hotel wasn't very kid friendly. My 13 year old complained about the cigarette smoke was amazed by the number of adults drinking liquor at the breakfast buffet. The buffet was also not a good family value and the food seemed old.

As far as the noise level. you could can definitely hear your neighbors come and go, but i live in hotels pretty much and that happens at the 5 star ones too!! i didnt think there were that many disruptions at all.. and i stayed on the 4th of July!!! did i fly slow motion into the fluffiest bed in the world absolutley not! But i didn't pay an extra 50 to 100 dollars for a fluffy bed either. I got a clean room, good nights sleep in a comfortable bed, with super sweet desk help. for the price i paid on the holiday in Los Angeles i got a steal and i would definitely stay here again. in a heartbeat."

4567,Gardena Terrace Inn,Gardena,2015-10-24T00:00:00Z,33.886224,-118.309143,3.0,"The hotel was in a perfect location for us because of where we had to go to that evening (less than 1 mile away). However, the hotel location as in an older run down area. The rooms were clean and well kept, but once outside the room, we did not feel safe in the hotel/motel because the security parking gate and stairways were left wide open all night. Overall, the room was OK, but the hotel safety was a question mark for us. One good thing is that Bob's Hawaiian Food is right next door and has the best Hawaiian food around."

At first glance the front desk is nice and remodeled and the person working was super nice. Going to the room, the elevator certificate was out of date and so was the ambiance. There is courtyard area in the middle of the hotel to sit which was nice. Inside the room it was large and all counter tops/tables remodeled with the same quartz as the front desk but inside the room was brown. The bathroom was also remodeled with body wash, shampoo, and conditioner dispensers on the inside of the wall but for our room, the body wash was completely drained and there were no bars of soap. There was one, clearly used bottle of body lotion by the sink but I feel soap is more important than lotion. We got in late and left early. This inn got the job done and that's about it. Kudos to the workers for being so kind and I'm sure the amenities would have been refilled if we had asked."

There's parking in a garage with cameras everywhere. It was comfortable pretty clean it could be cleaner. The window was old but the interior decorating was nice. There's flat screen tv on the wall and table and chair is updated. The door hits the toilet when you try to close door but not a big deal. The freezer wasn't cold enough and it was a new looking half refrigerator. But overall I would come back here again. I enjoyed my stay for its purpose.

4589,Gardena Terrace Inn,Gardena,2015-11-09T00:00:00Z,33.886224,-118.309143,2.0,"I stayed a night coz I did not want to drive 2 hours back to San Diego in the wee hours of the morning after a night out with friends. Checked in around 3PM... The room was warm as the A/C was not on. So I turned it on and about an hour later, the room was still warm... Why The A/C is one of those window type units and this particular one was right in front of the bed closest to the door so the bed essentially blocked the vents. The room also smelled of cigarette smoke even though it was a non-smoking room from what I understood. In the bathroom area, the mirror was resting on the counter behind the faucet as it looked like it had fallen from the hook on the wall. The pillows were lumpy and the sheets/pillow cases were not the softest. But like my title says, I just needed the room to sleep in after night out. I'm not complaining, just stating it as it was. If lumpy pillows and slightly stiff sheets aren't your thing, then this ain't the place for you. Otherwise, it does what it needs to do and serves its purpose."

Overall the hotel was perfect since we only stayed briefly at nights to sleep and were on the go during the days. There is nothing special here. No breakfast (not even coffee or continental as advertised) but it was clean. The front desk staff were nice and got us extra towels and directions."

One of those days that I had to ask for towels, they did not have two sets available. The sheets were dingy and pilly. The continental breakfast was the worst I have ever experienced at a hotel--one day, there was no breakfast left and it was not replenished. You can hear conversations of the room next door through the walls. There is free parking and a great Thai place next door. Staff were friendly."

It smelled gross. There was blood on the wall. There was damage to the bathroom door. People were talking right outside our room all through the night, and by morning, the room reeked of cigarette smoke, and that is when I realized the ashtray was three inches from our room's only window, which explained almost all of the aforementioned points. To top things off, a pipe in the garage leaked on our rental car throughout the night, and I had to take our rental car to a car-wash to get the murky watermarks off the car before returning it. My wife and I hotel-hopped throughout our week-long vacation (all of the rooms we stayed at were about the same price), and this was the only hotel we ended up staying that did not have a breakfast, pool, etc., so that doesn't help either when remembering our stay there."

It loozed a little run down and the luggage cart was filthy. We had no choice but to stay because we wereally told that if we didnt,they we would still be charged 172 because they held the room for us. There were cigareties burns all over the jacuzzi, and my husband had to kill and flush a huge bug that was in it. The towels were old, dingy and brittle. The deadbolt on the front door didn't work. And,the patio do didn't have any kind of security lock, although the patio was adjacent to another room. Which meant if we had left our things there to go sightseeing, the people in the adjacent room could've easily broken into our room and stolen our things. To add insult to injury,the hotel charged my credit card twice and I had to call them about it and then wait days for them to return the other 172 that I clearly needed to pay for another hotel, since I was on vacation. The overall experience was very disappointing and caused a serious decline in the quality of our vacation..."

The room didn't have a dresser to put clothes away and the bar in the closet was coming off the wall. The shower was pretty bad. The pressure was too hard and you couldn't adjust it. We could hear the pipes rattle through the walls, when our neighbors would use their sink. We stayed there for a week and actually thought about checking out early to stay somewhere else.

At 11p when I step out my room there were random young adults just hanging around the terrace. They were there when I left and when I returned. There was no security. Doubtful I'll return, but for the price, for some it'll get the job done. The online pictures and reviews are what I went by but had an entirely different feel and experience when I stayed."

This looks as if it were once an old crummy hotel but they really did try with the upgrades. Carpet looked a little dirty and it looked as if someone wrote graffiti on the mirror at one time, but it had been cleaned. The bathroom was clean, the shower worked just great. They do skimp on the towel and toilet tissue quality but compared to the other hotels on this street, I definitely felt safer and cleaner here."

We had party-noisy neighbors on one side, and I had to call the desk about them one night. I heard the neighbor receive the call and they quieted down.

Complementary breakfast was poor and served in a room that can fit no more than 10 people.. Room was ugly (bed, bath, ...). The only thing I save is the location... but the place is so small that it's not really difficult to be near the shops, restaurants and Morro rock... you can likely find a better deal for the same (low) quality."

The room are on the smaller side but the ceiling fans and sliders with small balcony help with stuff air feeling. Yes, older hotel but it has character! No pool but the spa is very large which the kids enjoyed. Breakfast options were typical but nice. The hotel is on the smaller side so it makes it nice for not a lot of foot traffic in the halls and breakfast."

There is no a/c, but there are balconies with sliding doors. The problem was the locks on the screen doors didn't work.

Its nice to be able to comfortably walk to the main events. You will have to drive to Morro Rock and The State Beach but there's plenty of parking and its an easy drive. Morro Bay is a great vacation destination and really a beach community. The San Marcos Best Western was delightful, offered a generous continental breakfast and wine and cheese every evening. Make sure you get an Ocean Bay View room there is no air conditioning and on the ocean side you do not need it. There's so much to do, The Hearst Castle, Cambria, walk along the Boardwalk to view The Elephant Seals on and on it goes you cant get bored and all of it invites you to relax enjoying the beautiful Central Coast of California. Oh and yes WINE, and more wine Vineyards close by. That really helps in the relaxation mode. HAVE FUN! We are going back!"

Breakfast is okay, don't expect cooked to order food, but better than just pastries and granola bars. Happy hour is nice touch. Cable gets quite a few stations. Location was great for us: easy highway access and plenty of things to do within walking distance. We'll come back someday hopefully. Room was comfy (just very warm) . Don't forget about the jacuzzi.

There were complimentary 3 kinds of cheese, tea, coffee, cakes. The breakfast is good and there is no need to go to restaurants instead: cookies, juices, tea, coffee, eggs, cheese, etc. Walking distance to marina where live sea elephants and you will find many shops and restaurants. I avoid the use of conditioners and for fresh air in night, I opened the small window in the bathroom and the door therein. That small window opens into the spacious hall (like atrium) with cool pleasant air. I am not sure whether the big outer window could be opened but I had no need doing that."

It's something I've always assumed was standard, esp. for a Best Western. The room had a ceiling fan, and a sliding glass door with a screen door. There was one small window in the bathroom that opened into the hotel hallway/atrium. The bathroom didn't have a vent fan. So I had to leave the bathroom window open, and yes, anyone walking down the hallway could hear a person doing their business through the bathroom window. From now on when I book a hotel I will make sure fully air conditioned is one of the room amenities."

After a nice walk with no problems we went back to our room and decided to get in their hot tube. Oh my, a big hot tube that was heated to 101deg with many jets. We melted in the water.

And in need of updating. (New carpet, some minor wall damage throughout hallways, etc.) But it is also obvious that said changes are taking place. A new swimming pool is being added on the 2nd floor, etc. This was my 1st art show in Richmond, and the hotel was about 7 minutes from the venue. Which made it so much easier to get well rested and be at my best. The morning breakfast was wonderful as well. But I must say, the staff at this location ARE 5 star!

My daughter's room was subjected to loud noise from neighboring misbehaving guests until 3 am. The desk clerk on Saturday morning seemed overwhelmed by guest issues/complaints.

They are slow, falling apart, creaky and honestly a little scary. The hotel staff is nice though and they have free breakfast.

It fits the bill perfectly. Check in was quick and cordial. The elevator was old and worn but in good repair and worked fine it was probably slow and shaky at the time it was built. No problem for me. Room was clean and quiet, with worn furnishings, upgraded tight but functional bathroom, firm bed. I arrived late left early."

It's reliable, affordable and generally I have always been happy when I have stayed here. The free hot breakfast is a nice touch and staff is generally accommodating and helpful. This time however, it seems that the air conditioning was not working in my room, something I wasn't aware of until I finally retired for the evening. Despite setting the thermostat to 60 and the function to cool, it was hot, humid and made it very difficult to sleep comfortably. It was late at night when I turned in, so I bit the bullet because I didn't feel like packing up and moving to another room in the middle of the night. Maybe this was just a malfunction of the A/C in my room and the rest of the rooms are fine, but I would check when you arrive to ensure that you didn't have the same experience that I did. Having said that, I have had enough positive experiences here in the past that it would not stop me from staying here again."

The gym had no air at all,a broken treadmill weights 20lbs over. Room was TINY. There was also the smell of marijuana on the 5th floor and partying in resulted in someone pulling the fire alarm at midnight and we had to be evacuated. No one from the front desk ever came to use someone staying here said we could come in. Its not worth the price.You can get a much better hotel at the same rate.

The elevator was only large enough for 1 person and a suitcase. I didn't feel safe for myself or my automobile. As I said earlier I left for another hotel. This hotel does not meet the criteria not represent Hotwire. It's rated 2.5 but is clearly a 1. I was too upset and pressed to get out of there I didn't stop to take pictures.
4899,Quality Inn and Suites,Richmond,2016-06-13T00:00:00Z,37.56611,-77.47481,3.0,"Hotel was quite and clean. Room, frig., microwave and updated bathroom were clean. Super soft pillows on the bed. My room had a stale smell, bring scented candles."
4900,Quality Inn and Suites,Richmond,2016-05-01T00:00:00Z,37.56611,-77.47481,2.0,"This may have been the place to stay 20 years ago but not now. The outside looks rundown, the sign was missing and the parking was in the rear under the second floor where the pool was. A little scary considering the neighborhood. When checking in there was a family group in the lobby, one of the men was wearing a T shirt that said What the F**k. The room was clean and some renovations were done lately. The breakfast was nice as was the area. In the morning of checkout there was what seemed to be a homeless person sitting in the lobby from the time I came down for breakfast at 7am and was still there when we checked out at 10am."
4901,Quality Inn and Suites,Richmond,2016-05-31T00:00:00Z,37.56611,-77.47481,4.0,room was in really good condition looks like it has under gone a recent renovation. the only issue was I put the key card in the wrong room door and the door opened.. went in went to bed then at 11 o'clock a man tried to enter the room saying it was his room..I tried to call the front desk but the phone did not have a cord to to the wall jack. I was able to reach the desk and asked them to let us stay in the room as we were settled in and give the other gentleman another room which they did. they next day i told the lady at the front desk of the situation and she went out of her way to say how sorry she was and was sending maintenance right away..all wells that ends well..really enjoyed the breakfast all the other guests were very friendly.
4902,Quality Inn and Suites,Richmond,2016-06-04T00:00:00Z,37.56611,-77.47481,3.0,We will stay here again. Meets our needs and is affordable and clean.
4903,Quality Inn and Suites,Richmond,2016-07-12T00:00:00Z,37.56611,-77.47481,2.0,"Super outdated hotel. Especially the rooms. Clean, but old, old, old. The carpet was coming away from the the wall, old curtains, and old elevator. The carpet was really the worst thing. The elevator did not work properly. Made everything feel dingy. Tiny bathrooms.....I mean tiny! The lobby is the only thing that felt decently up to date. Breakfast and staff were all great."
4904,Quality Inn and Suites,Richmond,2016-07-10T00:00:00Z,37.56611,-77.47481,1.0,"I am a person that reads reviews but I have never written one before. However, after staying here for two nights i had to give my honest opinion. I was very disappointed with this hotel true it is an older hotel but major repairs are needed starting with the 2 elevators which one has an out of order sign on.. anytime you try to go to the first floor it automatically takes you to the basement then brings you back up. The basement looks scary and filthy if I had the opportunity to see the basement first i know i would never have stayed at this hotel. This is first time I ever felt unsafe at a hotel. The parking deck area needs better lighting to dark. My room was on the 4th floor the hallway smells maybe the carpet needs shampooing or just needs new carpet. The room was clean but bed was very lumpy new mattress needed ...shower pressure was horrible at anytime of the day really horrible ...the free breakfast i woulnt dare eat it do to the lack of upkeep of the facility hotel was...I can't comment on the staff I only saw the front desk person never saw housekeeping crew or maintenance person the hold time.....Otherwise, if the above things dont really bother you then the hotel does offer you a quiet room ....great location (it may not look like it from your hotel window but you're really close to a lot of things) ...good rates...sorry I didn't mean to write a book just wanted to give an honest opinion of my experience. ..."
4905,Quality Inn and Suites,Richmond,2016-07-20T00:00:00Z,37.56611,-77.47481,2.0,The elevator wasn't working the first night and I had the choice of 4the or 5th floor. The fitness center only consist of an eliptical and a treadmil. I chose this hotel because it had a rating of a 3/5. But it definitely deserves a 2/5.
4906,Quality Inn and Suites,Richmond,2016-04-01T00:00:00Z,37.56611,-77.47481,1.0,This hotel needs work. It was very bad
4907,Quality Inn and Suites,Richmond,2016-05-06T00:00:00Z,37.56611,-77.47481,2.0,One can argue that the quality of this hotel was good for the money. We had a reasonable rate and stayed here. The hotel is on a central street within a few miles of downtown Richmond. It is not located at a great neighborhood. The general condition of the hotel and the rooms is fair.

4913,Quality Inn and Suites,Richmond,2016-04-23T00:00:00Z,37.56611,-77.47481,3.0,"Although the hotel and its rooms are not brand new, they are well maintained. Good beds. The only thing I didn't like is that the walls are rather thin. If you are unlucky, your neighbors snore or make other noises (which bugs me)."

The hotel is nice and in a very nice location near the Richmond Convention Center and other important businesses. The room was very clean and the bed was very comfortable. Everything I needed was available the room even had a microwave and refrigerator. If by chance I may need to visit Richmond, VA again I would like to return to this hotel for another stay."
4915,Quality Inn and Suites,Richmond,2016-07-17T00:00:00Z,37.56611,-77.47481,2.0,"The hotel is in need of a good update in the general areas. I thought it was out of business when I first pulled up to it, but it was the wrong door. Although the rooms were clean, expectations should be set on how old the lobby, elevators and halls are."
4916,Quality Inn and Suites,Richmond,2016-08-06T00:00:00Z,37.56611,-77.47481,4.0,"Room ok. Was not cleaned 100. Sadly, no bell carts available. Room was 4th floor on very end of hall. Very long hall/haul with no cart..3 trips to car to get all unloaded. Hotel needs updated/renovation."

4919,Quality Inn and Suites,Richmond,2016-04-07T00:00:00Z,37.56611,-77.47481,3.0,The elevators were old and rickety and broke down Saturday morning. The steps were dark and smelled of stale cigarettes. There were homeless people.crashing in the lobby. It looks like Richmond houses people there. The parking garage was dark and obstructed from view if hotel. The iron steps in garage are old and rusty and wobbly. The hotel is being renovated . it has an outdated appearance and cheap fixes. For the price it's okay.it's in a rough neighborhood-inner-city Richmond. The breakfast was good and the ladies were really nice who did the breakfast.

4967,Best Western of Long Beach,Long Beach,2016-05-06T00:00:00Z,33.78864,-118.189464,2.0,Noisy streetcar running all night. Ceiling creaking from person walking like an elephant above. TV couldn't tune into any channel. The alarm radio kept buzzing when my phone was near it. Phone gets priority on night stand.. moved the alarm away. Elevator starts to move even when door is open.. I ended up taking the stairs.. didn't want to risk getting stuck. Towels are cheap. Ripped a bit of the towel just drying off after a shower without even trying.. breakfast was alright. Nothing to really write about. Neighborhood isn't too great but that's LBC for ya.

4973,Best Western of Long Beach,Long Beach,2016-05-17T00:00:00Z,33.78864,-118.189464,4.0,Great place to stay if you are going on a cruise ship. Secure parking while you are at sea and a shuttle to and from the pier. Also great breakfast and a friendly staff. A straight shot down the boulevard to downtown Long Beach.
4974,Best Western of Long Beach,Long Beach,2016-10-15T00:00:00Z,33.78864,-118.189464,2.0,"When we first looked at our room, it looked as expected. Clean, etc. When we used the bathroom however, I noticed that everything was very very low to the ground: toilet, shower sink counter--So much so that I had to bend my knees and strain my back to reach my hands under the faucet to wash my hands. Kind of annoying since standard counter height for bathrooms now is 36. This counter height was around 26-27 high so I was not happy with that part. Also, water pressure was very low--so that was also annoying. When I woke up---I had bites on my arm that weren't there the night before when I went to sleep. When I went to check out in the morning -- I told the hotel employees about this. The man behind the counter said that since I booked with Hotels.com, they weren't able to do anything compensatory like a discount, etc. First of all---I never asked for a discount or compensation. Besides, it's not a Hotels.com issue---it's a Best Western issue! Later the manager did call me and thanked me for letting them know. He said he would call me back after a thorough room inspection. He never did. Two days later, the bites are still there---but are now healing. I was grossed out and worried about bringing whatever that was back to my house! Also--breakfast was practically inedible. They were out of everything anyway because they were super crowded due to the end-of-breakfast stampede. Suggestion--extend the weekend breakfast hours or start later on the weekends."

The Hotel itself was fine but not being from the area and seeing the name of town called called Long Beach you think it was ok. I was told downtown had decent places to eat and found none, just fast food stores, closed up businesses and many people hanging out on streets asking for money. If you stay here make sure you eat before checking in or have someone who knows the area take you out to eat. The hotel was fine I had no issues with it, don't misunderstand me, the location of it was an issue."

I was mixed minded about that because my purpose was to site see but I did good within those two days. The neighborhood is not a bad neighborhood. The breakfast at the hotel was OK and decent. The hotel is very clean. My sofa bed wouldn't unfold out but that was OK, my son slept with me.

Front desk service was very good. This was not a 2.5 star. It was terrible. I had a bad feeling when we pulled in and half the neon sign that says 'Hampton Inn' was out. I would not recommend this hotel.

I would say, many 12-15 yr. old boys. The pool was very crowded as was the fitness room and breakfast room in the morning. I also feel that for the price, a room with 2 Q beds, for 4 people, should be a little larger and include more seating options.....and, should have 2 part bathroom with 2 sinks."

There was dust on the table between the beds, plastic bags were not in the trash cans and I had to put our trash on the counter in the bathroom. There was dust on top of the head boards and the lights. I was very surprised that there was not a microwave in the room as nowadays most places do."

We called and they said the manager would get back to us but never did. We mentioned it at checkout and not even an apology. The location was disappointing. Overall it was not worth the rate we paid."

The shampoo/ conditioner/ lotion were all half full (used). The toilet did not work right. The bathroom door did not close all the way. The toilet paper holder was broken. The room was fine for what we needed. The bed was super comfy. We were able to control the temperature in the room no problem. The lovely lady who ran breakfast was charming and helpful with the guests. Always a smile on her face. Breakfast was yummy. Nice selection. The kids working the front desk were helpful but could have been a little more personable. Aside from those little things we had a nice stay for the price we paid.

The front desk made perfunctory but unsuccessful attempts to restore it. The parking area could not accomodate all the cars so we had park in unauthorized areas. The breakfast area was so crowded that tables were doubled up. When I pointed some of these issues out to the manager on call I was advised to take up any issue with the provider through which I booked the room. I cannot wait to go back.

Breakfast was corporate traveler average with hot and cold selections. A small tray of freshly baked cookies were available for one hour at 5pm. There was a refrigerator, but no microwave, unless you chose to use the one in the lobby breakfast area. Wifi was fine. The side door to the heated pool and spa was adjacent to a smoker's station and often propped so the room keycard security was defeated. The hotel location was very good for access to I-95 and the Beeline Expressway to the Gulf Coast, however evening commuter traffic on the I-95 south of our location was very bad, due to construction, so check traffic websites and plan alternate routes accordingly. We visited several local attractions and drove along the coastline roads to explore the area for a future visit, so this worked well for us."

Shower curtain bowed out for extra room. Lobby smelled of fresh cookies. Breakfast seating comfortable and well maintained. Staff perhaps the friendliest I've had. Hotel surroundings busy and pool by parking lot, but it was a nice area and nice pool. Every restaurant, shop, and gas, right there. Very busy exit but was easy in and out."

Location - Quite convenient. Right off I-75. close to restaurants, stores. 25 minutes drive to Siesta Key beaches and Lido beaches. Personnel/check in - Average. Overall appearance - The hotel is old and worn out and needs updating. The carpets are worn out and seem dirty. Carpets in some areas of our room were ripped. The restroom in the lobby area was disgusting and worse than a public restroom!! Totally unacceptable. Beds - Acceptable, comfortable. Bathrooms- The bathrooms need to be cleaner. There was mold on the shower curtain on the inside. Water temps and pressure was acceptable. Room - Room lacked storage. No drawers to store belongings. They do have a couple of shelves but are not adequate. Breakfast - Area is very small and does not accomodate normal volumes. Inadequate seating in area. Breakfast items are not replinshed on a regular basis and appeared to be very disorganized. Quality of breakfast items is below average than the Hamptons I have been in in the past. Number of people handling breakfast was very less and were not able to keep up. Juice was watered down including Florida orange juice!! Pool and hot tub - This was good and well maintained and we used it a lot. In general this Hampton falls short in many areas and I do not recommend it."

When the restaurant we were going to for supper was closed we called the desk and they gave us a restaurant nearby. Excellent suggestion. The room itself was on the 4th floor, very quiet, bed comfortable. Many TV stations available. The air conditioner was efficient and kept us comfortable without a lot of fiddling and adjusting. The one drawback was there was not a micro fridge or microwave in the room. Our fault, we should have read the amenities closer. Breakfast was nice, fruit, make your own waffles, variety of dry cereal, hot eggs and sausage. A little something for everyone. A nice side for me was we arrived just before a storm and the warnings were posted at the desk. Having been in a couple of tornadoes throughout my life, I was relieved to know there is a designated safe room on both ends of the hotel for just that occasion. May not seem important, but if you have been in a tornado you know how comforting it can be to know there is a place to be safe just in case. I would recommend this hotel, just remember to bring a cooler for your leftovers."

We couldn't get into the room until after 3pm which was fine. When we got to the room felt the room needed a good vacuum and deep cleaning of bathroom.

Free breakfast was much better than expected, and the woman working the waffle iron went out of her way to make sure everyone was taken care of. Beds were very comfortable. Only complaint- the bathroom was beaten up and tub stained. And the kid's pool looked dirty and disgusting. Never saw any little ones in there, thank goodness."

One of the best breakfast buffets on the trip. Comfortable bed. We had a suite and our adult daughter slept pin the pull-out-sofa.

Breakfast was very nice.Eggs a little watery (institutional, pseudo-eggs), but the selection was great! Overall, very nice breakfast!Hours of operation of breakfast terrific! Only disappointment:the mattress/pillows. Woke non-rested. Pillows too small and soft, mooshy. Mattress just so-so. Hotel overall pretty, clean, nice amenities,friendly staff. Will definitely stay again, recommend to others. Please tell front desk to let people know about the Chinese Buffet which is close by. Not fancy, but food selection is good, very clean, very nice staff, and price is right! Downtown is a great place to eat, but pricey for 2 meals several days in a row! Thank you for a lovely stay in a lovely hotel!"

At Check-In, I happened to mention conversationally that it was our anniversary. To our surprise, they upgraded our room to a very romantic suite. (It must've been a slow night). The room had everything we could possibly need for our comfort. The view from our window was breathtaking (even saw a hot air balloon). The staff were kind and attentive beyond what we could have hoped for. They treated us like family. Let me add that this is a GREAT place to bring your kids. Instead of a pool, they have an indoor waterpark for all ages. The pictures don't do it justice. They have a hot protein-rich breakfast that is worth paying (over a budget hotel). Play pens and roll-away beds are available when you need them. Great hotel for parents with kids. If I have to be negative, I would say my TV wasn't big enough. First world problems, right And its a not exactly in the heart of downtown. But those things are just being picky. Overall, GREAT stay and would highly recommend it to anyone."

We went down to breakfast, and the staff was trying to close up the room 45 minutes before breakfast was to be over due to small crowd. When my daughter went to get a refill on OJ with 20 minutes left to closing, we were told that the orange juice was done for the day. We just kind of shook our heads and chuckled at the curtness of the staff. We like to visit Galena, but we'll look around at other places to stay first."

Our view was a roof. The TV was small and the internet was very slow. The positives include a good breakfast with plenty of choices, as well as a swimming pool and fitness center (though the fitness center did not have much). We had a tough time sleeping because we could hear the footsteps of the people on the floor above us. Overall our stay was average."

The rooms are HUGE, the bed was very comfortable, the TV has so many channels, it would be impossible not to find something that suited you. The breakfast was very good, although the seating area is pretty cramped. The hotel staff were very friendly and called to make sure we were settled in a half or so after we arrived. We really only have two comments to consider (for both hotel management and those who might want to stay here). First, we were surprised that our room did not have a refrigerator. It's easily one of the largest hotel rooms we have stayed in, so there's plenty of space. Galena is known for its restaurants, and we, like many guests, had leftovers. Thankfully, the temps were low enough that we were able to store it in the car. For such a nicely equipped and modern place, the lack of a refrigerator was surprising. Second, our A/C-heater unit was noisy. I have gotten so used to those things being noisy that I'm considering writing the Amana company and asking them WHY their hotel units are all universally noisy, even when relatively new. It rattled and there was not amount of pushing, shoving, or kicking that would make it stop. We would definitely stay here again when visiting Galena, though we now know to remember we don't have a place to store leftovers. Overall, it's a wonderful hotel."

Usually, we pay cash but, I went ahead and prepaid on my debit card. Once at the hotel. The front desk stated he needed to run it for incidentals. The usual fee for incidentals is 10 to 50 dollars. I was charged the cost of the room again. This is not just this hotel but, becoming an issue with all hotels in Galena. We stayed on Thursday and it took a phone call and eventually by the following Tuesday my money was refunded. Also, our room was against the laundry room. In the middle of the night twice we were awoke by loud machine noises. Was told we would be given extra points on our hotels .com account for the issue. Nothing has showed up there yet. I have recommended this hotel to our friends and family in the past. We come up to Galena at least every 3 months. Not , sure if we will use this one again. Do not stay in room 224 unless they have fixed there laundry machines."

The breakfast is wonderful especially due to the fact that it has real plates and real silverware. The staff at breakfast was so friendly and so helpful. 3 people keeping everything completely filled and hot. You will not be sorry if you stay at this hotel. It is worth every penny. Also, fresh homemade cookies at the front desk at all times."

There is a very impressive pool area with giant slide, but I did not use it. Several others seemed to enjoy it though. It is marketed as an indoor water park, and it is certainly to the closest thing to a water park in the area. Galena is cute and small, albeit somewhat lacking for a city slicker like me. However, I really love staying in these areas. Service is friendly and basic, and breakfast is a hot buffet with plenty of coffee. Couldn't ask for more at the price."

When we got there I realized I was getting charge again for what was prepaid. When I brought this to the clerk's attention, there was no discretion. Then to make matters worse I got charged AGAIN. That made 3 times! The new clerk couldn't figure out how to reverse it even while being coached on the phone for a LONG time while we were standing there in the small lobby. He still didn't get that he'd charged me twice. He finally called his manager who came back to work. I got called back with no apologies or comps. Then the manager loudly brought it up again as we were having breakfast. I still don't understand what happened, but over 500 was taken out of my checking account and has not found its way back. I understand taking a credit card number in case there are other charges made during the stay, but this was way beyond that. It took about an hour of our time during our stay, not to mention the lack of discretion. It was very disheartening. The room was a disappointment. Yes, there was a fireplace but no way to sit in front of it and maybe have a glass of wine-just the bed. One chair was on the other side of the bed. The steamboat theme came from a print on the wall. It was mostly like another hotel room-not a wow factor, but plenty expensive."

Now I understand the 24 hour cancellation rule but we had a vehicle breakdown and couldn't make it. It was expensive enough without an extra room charge. Will go elsewhere next time.

This was the first time we ever had to wait to get in our room because of the housekeeping was running behind. I understand these things happen but that was one reason i couldn't give this hotel a higher rating. Breakfast was good but breakfast room could be bigger or maybe a patio area for more seating . Pool area was very nice with plenty of towels and was very clean as was the rest of the hotel. One thing i should mention is that a couple days before my wife and i were supposed to stay there i realized i made reservations for the wrong dates ! I called Hotels.com and they contacted this hotel and made the change for the correct dates, thank you so much to Hotels.com and Country Inns And Suites for your understanding!"

Only had two issues. TV picture was horrible. Not HD. Not a big deal for one night. Asked for extra 30 minutes to check out and was told they don't do late check out. First time I've ever been denied. Overall though a nice place

One poor woman trying to keep up with dozens of people eating Sunday breakfast meant that they were constantly out of EVERYTHING. Ended up having to wait 15 minutes for coffee. The buffet ran out of juice, coffee, bread products, eggs, flatware, plates. Very sad."

This was probably the worst room I've ever paid that kind of money for. The bed was very comfortable, but that's all I can say that's positive. The hotel, room and the bathroom are run down and need updating. The hallways and stairwells smell strongly of smoke. There was a big empty space in our room where I imagine a chair/ottoman or recliner should have been and wasn't. The room had a mini fridge but no drinking glasses of any kind. Luckily we did not spend much time here, but it made the price we paid even a worse value than it already was."

Right off I-96, easy to get to and a Meijer grocery store across the street. It was the guests that were obnoxious - hockey parents and kids. Loud and rude, propped the outside back door open all night for both nights we stayed, monopolized all common areas, left trash in halls, didn't watch kids in the hot tub, entitled behavior galore."

The TV itself was a nice new model, but the cable was fuzzy and standard definition. I know this was probably an isolated situation, but the people in the room next to me were loudly fighting with and screaming at one another at midnight. Someone else then was singing and whistling at 6:00 A.M. Odd."

There was a group at the hotel the weekend we stayed. The smell of weed was covered through the hotel. The staff told us there was nothing they could do because they don't know if they had a medical card or not to smoke weed however we had to go outside to smoke cigarettes. My daughter was racially harassed by another guest. All the hotel did was give us an extra hour to checkout. The pool water was freezing and hot tub wasn't very hot or deep. The pool had tons of ppl under the age of 18 acting like fools most of the time. Will NOT return to this hotel.
5658,Best Western Hospitality Hotel and Suites,Grand Rapids,2016-02-01T00:00:00Z,42.91294,-85.5323,5.0,Convenient location. Affordable price. Stayed before leaving on vacation by plane. Was allowed to leave my car free of charge while gone. Shuttle service to and from the airport was prompt and courteous. Breakfast was available. Pool and hot tub were clean and enjoyable. Staff was extremely helpful and made sure our stay was great. Rooms were being renovated and updated. Only downside was the elevator was out of order but was being fixed the next day.

You get a 15 percent discount at Branns Restaurant next door when you tell them your stating at the Best Western ! They too have great food and service! If I had to say I could better one thing about our stay it would have to be that the hot tub jets do not bubble the hot tub , they only blow. That is the main purpose and reason many do enjoy a hot tub. Other than that I give this Best western 5 stars! Let me add they have a really good breakfast bar as well free w stay!

We were able to check in a bit early and return our rental car using the hotel shuttle. The room was clean and spacious, plenty of room for a family of 4. The only complaint on cleanliness would be that the shower was clogged. There were a few restaurants within walking distance serving good local beers, and the kids enjoyed the pool. The shuttle got us to the airport super early for our flight, which was appreciated. We felt this hotel paid attention to detail and actually tried to earn our business, as there are a few choices in the area for airport access."

Also, I left a pair of sweat pants in my room and have tried to contact the hotel management and they have told me they never found my belongings. So, they probably stole them. Not that money can't buy more, but they were more expensive than the room. I also didn't care for the fact that the only way to enter was through the front door.

When we arrived our room was absolutely disgusting - dirty towels and sheets thrown about all over the room, nothing was wiped down, and it smelled like smoke even though it was apparently a non-smoking room. We complained and the man at the front desk said there was nothing he could do and claimed the room was clean even though we had JUST walked from there and took pictures. He refused to refund our money or give us a new room, so we left and stayed at the Marriot next door. We called back later to again try and get a refund and he hung up on us. The staff is very unprofessional here, PLEASE don't waste your money. The cleaning staff was just hanging out in the food area (while they should have been cleaning our room!!) and the man who worked at the front desk had his family just hanging out in the lobby. Everything would have been find if we had a. Been given a new room, b. Gotten a refund, or c. Had the cleaning staff re-clean our room. None of which happened.

I decided to give it a try since the cancellation time had expired. Before paying for my room, I asked to go see the actual room I would be staying in. I checked the bed and didn't see any bugs and the room looked clean, so it would work for us. Of course after asking to look at the room, the guy checking us in was not happy with me. For a 2 star hotel, it was a good value, clean and comfortable. The continental breakfast was better than I thought it would be.

Tv is in a really odd place and it's hard to watch. Check out is at 11 in my case I stayed three days and cleaning service comes at 930 and 10 while I was still asleep and i got woke up all 3 days. I put the do not disturb on the door and it was taken off and I never got it back. Shower curtain doesn't keep water in shower so when you get out you have to mop the floor up from all the water going all over the bathroom. Fridge in the room is tiny and doesn't keep anything Coke. Has a funky smel from them shutting the air off and letting the room sit there so there's no moving air. But kick the air on and move the air around and he smell goes away quickly. I only spent 38 per night they hotels.com so for the cost it wasn't bad at all. Nothing major. Over all the Staff was very friendly. Safe part of town and close to interstate, food places and a Kroger."

There was an instant odor as soon as you opened the door. It wasn't clean at all. The shower was gross chipped.

For forty some dollars I feel that I got what I paid for. I liked that it was close to I40 and the front desk was manned at my 3:30am arrival. As soon as I entered the room it had a noticeable bad smell - the smell wasn't unbearable - and was quite warmer than the lobby and outside temperature even with the AC in full force. The furniture was outdated and the room didn't have a microwave. I would not stay here if you are looking to be comfortable, however, for what I needed it was perfect: cheap, not far from the hwy, easy check in and out. Would recommend if you are heading west or north of TN and Knoxville is an opportune place to stop for a short amount of time. Would not recommend if you are trying to enjoy the city for a couple days."

No matter where you set the thermostat. It never gets any colder. They were going to send somebody after maintenance to look at it. But it was 3 in the morning when we went to bed. Didn't want somebody in my room that late. The casino needs new chairs the ones they have are very uncomfortable. Trying to sit at a table for hours upon hours is hard to do. The bathrooms in the casino are located at each end makes it hard to get up and go to the bathroom from a table. Since the tables are in the middle of the casino. Poor design for bathrooms. But drinks were great my drink was never empty playing on the tables or at the slot machines. Which is extremely nice. Everybody was very friendly for the most part. I will stay again.

5893,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2016-07-02T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,4.0,"I had booked a non smoking room. Unfortunately when we arrived we were booked in a smoking room. We thought it would be ok but it was actually gross and we hated it. We asked to be switched to a non smoking room and they told us they couldn't do it due to availability. By the time we departed, we all had sinus infections."
5894,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2016-08-02T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,4.0,Enjoyed our stay can't wait to go again !! I would recommend the hotel designate smoking areas in the lobby area instead!! The lobby smells like smoke !!
5895,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2016-07-31T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,5.0,"Clean,quiet,comfortable and spacious room with a wonderful view.(also with a mini refrigerator).Casino setup is well laid out.The buffet (lunch) was excellent."
5896,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2016-06-30T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,5.0,Love it!! I will be coming back
5897,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2016-08-21T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,5.0,We had a very pleasant stay at the IP. Service and food were great. Stayed 3 days.
5898,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2016-07-09T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,3.0,"We went to the IP for a quick getaway for our anniversary, the room we were placed in had dirty towels from previous guest on the shower curtain, the sheets had hair as well. They moved us to a second room and when my wife went to step in the shower , the shower door fell forward hitting her on the shoulder. They did rectify this by moving us to a suite and giving us dinner for free. However, it was a horrible start to our anniversary. The hotel is at the casino and there are plenty of other things to do at the site. That's a plus."
5899,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2016-07-11T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,5.0,Awesome time. We loved the pool area also.
5900,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2016-06-24T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,4.0,"The pool experience was great, a little crowded but great to relax and soak up the sun. The room needed more attention, stains on the wall and carpet and didnt like the fact that the A/C controlled by the hotel."
5901,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2016-07-04T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,4.0,Beautiful hotel. I am a non smoker and even though we had a non smoking room the smell is in everything. It is s very nice place if you can deal with cigarette smoke
5902,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2016-07-13T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,3.0,"Would not stay here again. When we arrived our room smelled of sewage. Had to be moved, took several hours of our trip time. Advertised as a family place but way too many people for comfort. And nothing screamed family. The arcade room was not well equipped."
5903,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2016-07-17T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,5.0,Loved our overnight stay!
5904,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2016-07-17T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,5.0,The hotel was beautiful and well maintained. It was within a mile to the beach and shopping.
5905,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2016-09-07T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,3.0,Parking elevators too far from casino and room elevators for us old folks!
5906,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2016-08-07T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,4.0,Horrible experience with lady checking us in. Very rude told her 4 times we wanted a king bed. After getting to room discovered she put us in room with 2 doubles anyway. Called front desk and they were more than happy to swap our room to what we wanted. Great staff aside from one perdon
5907,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2016-06-26T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,5.0,"Was in Biloxi for business and got a good rate at IP. Like the restaurants and bars, too."
5908,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2016-08-25T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,5.0,I enjoyed a quick trip with my 2 kids and we had a wonderful time. The beautiful pool and arcade entertained my kids and the food was excellent. We will definitely visit again.
5909,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2016-09-27T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,5.0,"IP is a beautiful romantic type hotel! We stayed here on our wedding night and decided to come back for our one year anniversary, and it was awesome from valet to the staff! I live this Hotel!!!!"
5910,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2016-06-26T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,3.0,people coming from other areas where there is no smoking in any common areas it was very difficult to walk through the lobby while people smoke. Also no HBO in room.
5911,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2016-06-13T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,5.0,It was good but they shut down pool at 9 and opens at 10 but u can gamble all nite. That upset people! How will they comment to that
5912,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2016-06-27T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,4.0,"Our stay was nice. Casino wasn't the greatest. We didn't like the fact that they actually charged the 100 deposit to our card. Now we have to wait 5-7 days for a refund. None of the other hotels did that to us, including Beau Revage."
5913,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2016-09-25T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,5.0,I will plan another trip there
5914,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2016-06-05T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,4.0,"Everything was great! One thing: the water did not get hot enough for me. Maybe something small for someone else. But not for me. Aside from that, will stay again if I had to."
5915,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2016-09-07T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,4.0,I checked out around 2am. Only one person was ahead of me but it took 25- 30 mind to check out. The front desk clerk was deeply engaged in a personal conversation with the guest who was checking in. Neither one of them was concerned about me waiting to check out.
5916,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2016-07-06T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,4.0,Our stay was great until we received attitude from pool area staff because they kept asking if we needed something and when we would say no they started having attitudes toward us. Why would we need anything when we rented a cabana and received 10 free drinks to go in the mini fridge. The kids and I were there to enjoy the pool not buy food and drinks. Very disapointed with that service.
5917,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2016-08-07T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,5.0,"Stay was awesome!! Check in and out process was streamless. The pictures were very accurate for hotel rooms, pool, casino, and buffet and amenities. Well recommend if stressing in Biloxi. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner buffet were great!!"
5918,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2016-07-21T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,2.0,nothing good to say
5919,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2016-09-28T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,3.0,It was ok.some loud knocking not sure from where.the bed sheets didn't look like they have been washed had old hair an some dirt an the top blanket had some cigarette burn holes.
5920,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2016-07-13T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,3.0,"There was clearly tension in the air. It's Biliox, Mississippi.... Racial tension was within everyone. :-( Time heals!!!"
5921,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2016-07-16T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,1.0,"They were overbooked and put us in smoking room when we came in. The room was impossible for a non-smoker to stay. When we complained, they put us in accessible room still was not smoke free. This is a terrible hotel for non-smokers"
5922,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2016-07-14T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,1.0,Horrible. Walked to smoked filled lobby. Air quality of this hotel was horrible. The fact that you had to walk through lobby and go on opposite elevators to get to pool was ridiculous. Definitely not a family atmosphere. Will never stay at this hotel again.
5923,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2016-08-10T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,5.0,"This was our first time to stay in a Casino Resort. We loved the hotel, the staff, and the amenities, even though we did not participate in the gaming. There are plenty of things to do that don't involve gambling. My husband and I had a wonderful time."
5924,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2016-07-30T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,5.0,When I booked my room I had booked nonsmoking. When I checked in all that was available was smoking. I wasn't happy !!! I had just travel from Texas. I didn't have time to look for another hotel. I guess it makes no sense to book a room here. They clearly don't care!!!
5925,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2016-10-27T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,5.0,Great hotel
5926,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2016-06-19T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,5.0,Had an excellent stay
5927,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2016-07-17T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,4.0,I only have one issue. The parking garage is very far from the rooms. We had to carry a lot of personals would have been nice to have a cart to put our things on.
5928,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2016-07-04T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,5.0,"we stayed one night and loved it. perfect views from room, gambling was a blast. room was amazing.beach 5 minutes away if that."
5929,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2016-10-01T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,4.0,We were there for anniversary. Could t comped even a buffet.
5930,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2016-05-14T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,5.0,Had a great time! Valet was faster then parking in parking garage! Great service. Food at Tein was excellent!
5931,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2016-06-24T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,4.0,"Decided to go for our 6th anniversary. Went to the pool on day one and it was super crowded with kids, and saw lots of people with personal coolers and their own drinks. Day 2 decided to bring our small cooler with a couple of bottles of water. We got there early and there were no seats to be had, and kids EVERYWHERE, splashing-completely unregulated. :( We were yelled at by the pool staff as we were leaving for having the cooler/ drinks, when there were ton of other people there with the same thing. Very unprofessional on her part. She should have been stopping people at the front door, instead of yelling at guests while they were trying to relax. Other than that, our stay was very nice and the rest of the employees and hotel staff were very friendly."
5932,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2016-06-28T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,5.0,"Everything was positive about this hotel! Check in line was long but, moved along in a timely manner! We were even up graded to a better room which was awesome! We will definitely be staying at the IP again in the future and I will tell others about our pleasant experience!!"
5933,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2016-06-22T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,3.0,Check in was horrible. Took about an hour to get checked in. Check in staff was very slow. Check out staff was slow as well. Other than that had a great stay.
5934,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2016-06-14T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,3.0,The casino allows smoking and some of the rooms were smoking. That smell seeps into all areas of the hotel and for that reason we will not stay at the IP again.
5935,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2016-10-09T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,5.0,Enjoyed myself
5936,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2016-07-20T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,5.0,Great and easy access off of the highway
5937,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2016-07-25T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,3.0,"I did not like the pool separated from the hotel. I did not like taking one elevator in the hotel, walk to another elevator to get to the pool above the parking garage."
5938,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2016-06-20T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,4.0,It was great. The room was nice and the hotel had everything we could possibly ask for. The only thing missing was a microwave in the rooms.
5939,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2016-06-11T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,5.0,Two thumbs up
5940,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2016-07-30T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,2.0,Toilet overflowed in the am. Fight broke out outside our room. Had to call security. Room smelled of smoke even though non smoking room. Buffet line was an hour and a half. For 30 per person food was not good. Room was warm even though we lowered the thermostat.
5941,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2016-08-07T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,5.0,Very nice room. Very comfortable and a beautiful sunrise every morning.Bathroom was amazing. Dining was very good. Pretty close to beach and shopping. Will stay there again.
5942,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2016-06-27T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,4.0,not enough non-smoking areas in casino...coughed for 2 days because of all the smoke.
5943,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2016-07-10T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,4.0,very thin walls. heard children and adults screaming in the hallway all night long. lady at check in was rude and I was hit with another fee when I checked out. so I paid more than I had expected. the room was very nice and loved the view.
5944,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2016-07-28T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,4.0,"This is a hopping hotel, but it was very hard to find and the counter staff was cranky! Also, many of the restaurants are in the casino and hard to get to. Don't bring kids under 21."
5945,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2016-06-03T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,4.0,"The stay was very good. We will stay there again. We think this is the best hotel/casino for your dollar in the area. However there were little things (with our room) that we did not report. 1) The toilet ran 2) one of the phones was broken 3) the black out curtain was not completely operable due to broken hooks(morning light seeped in) 4) the air conditioning did not work properly as the thermostat needed to be set on 65 to have the room comfortable. I am sure if we could obtained another room, but did not think too much of the issues until we realized there were many. We did not want to unsettle ourselves."
5946,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2016-08-31T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,5.0,Hate i didnt come sooner
5947,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2015-10-24T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,5.0,"omg! had the best time at the america concert last nite& then had a fabulous meal @ costa cucina. ask for rosemary. the best server, ever!"
5948,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2016-07-05T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,5.0,Pool only open until 900
5949,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2016-08-19T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,3.0,"This stay taught me to not stay at a casino resort again. The room was clean and comfortable, but to get questions answered or any service was a nightmare of getting passed from one person to the next to the next (for something as simple as where can I place outgoing mail). The restaurants and shops inside are convenient, but you are going to pay dearly and wait a long time."
5950,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2014-08-10T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,3.0,i like spending money and this is a casino. i'm pretty happy.
5951,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2016-07-19T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,5.0,"Comfortable and fun..some of the staff was cordial, some were rude and the security staff was very helpful"
5952,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2016-06-14T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,4.0,"Very clean, well appointed rooms. No complaints at all! Hotel and casino are rather large. The bank of elevators for the casino and parking garage are quite a ways from the room tower elevators. We liked that because it forced us to get in more daily steps. There is a wonderful rooftop pool with a huge TV and fun bar. Family friendly, too!"
5953,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2016-06-03T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,4.0,The hotel was great. But the casino part had way too much smoke in the air. It was probably the worst I've been to.
5954,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2016-06-19T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,5.0,"Great room, food, and casino"
5955,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2016-06-05T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,5.0,Great hotel at great price. We really enjoyed it.
5956,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2016-06-07T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,4.0,Front desk a little slow at checkin. More agents would have sped up the wait time(about 20 min) Hotel clean and personnel all very nice.
5957,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2015-09-15T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,4.0,pays out better that the other casinos
5958,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2016-07-29T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,1.0,"Terrible vibe in this hotel. People and staff were unfriendly, room was stuffy compared to others we stayed in during our trip for the same price. Bed was uncomfortable. Did not enjoy our stay."
5959,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2016-06-28T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,4.0,"The room, location, and activities were great"
5960,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2016-07-05T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,5.0,Me and my 2 grandchildren went. 1 st time here. The game room needs to be bigger and security needs to be in game room at all times. I rented a cabana that was very nice. The bathroom and bathtub needed to be bigger. A luxury bathtub would have been nice.
5961,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2016-07-25T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,5.0,It was great but your slot machines were to darn tight.
5962,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2016-08-02T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,4.0,very enjoyable granddaughter loved the pool elevators were a little inconvenient but for a relaxing vacation it was great
5963,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2016-08-23T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,3.0,The room was clean and comfortable but I found that the staff was extremely unfriendly and almost rude.
5964,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2016-06-26T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,5.0,We stayed 5 nights. It was very clean the staff was awesome. There was plenty of things to do. The elevator situation was interesting. Sometimes there were so many people waiting it took a good half hour to reach your floor. Finally after being there a few days we would just get on one and eventually we would reach our destination.
5965,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2016-07-01T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,3.0,"I enjoyed my stay. I do think that there needs to be a few upgrades added in the rooms, such as renovations of tub and toilets, plus the addition of microwave."
5966,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2015-09-22T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,3.0,Visited here mainly because it was one of the first we saw and it a little late in the evening to go out. I had never been to a casino in MS and had been over 10 yrs for my husband. The food was great! We were extremely disappointed though that no one gave us any information about specials until after we had eaten. Turned out my husband could have gotten a free meal. The place was very nice but got little info on where we could find what we wanted and waited more then a half hour for the drinks we ordered.
5967,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2016-06-14T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,3.0,I thought that some of the staff were impatient and crude.
5968,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2015-04-03T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,3.0,Awesome concert tonight.. Quiet Riot
5969,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2016-07-17T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,5.0,"We usually stay at chain hotels, but IP provided a once in a while festive atmosphere, kids love it."
5970,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2016-07-26T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,4.0,We enjoyed our stay. The room was good and the view was good. The casino was current and easy to maneuver.
5971,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2016-06-19T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,4.0,Great hotel for the price. Room air conditioner not adequate which made for a long night. The hallway was nice a cold.
5972,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2014-09-26T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,4.0,great wings @ storts bar
5973,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2014-09-26T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,1.0,We stayed at the IP on July 10th and 11th weekend. We chose to stay here as we had tickets to see ZZ TOP. The auditorium was an excellent venue to see any concert in. We fully enjoyed the concert. The staff at the IP are very friendly and we did not find anyone that was not. We did not like the Hotel Room as it was probably the worst Casino Hotel room I have ever stayed in. The entire place especially in the Hotel rooms has a musky smell. It could be a smoke smell but we had a Non smoking room. Casino was fine but I will never stay at this Hotel again as for the smell and the actual rooms were much less than desirable. Nice friendly place but the Hotel part just sucks. Go here and Enjoy but I seriously recommend staying somewhere else.

Casino is our favorite and michelle is the best, most efficient beverage server ever. Keeping her 'mt's picked up. She has an enormous ability to make old people feel young. Her smile and upbeat attitude is the bright spot in our saturdays."

5978,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2016-10-12T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,5.0,"Great hotel, will stay here anytime we are in the area. Only negative, was the cold water faucet in the bathroom had very little water pressure."

5981,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2016-09-14T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,3.0,"I had a sprained ankle and asked for assistances with my bags, no one showed up. We waited 15 to 20 minutes. My air conditioner was not working properly, I also ask if they had a microwave to use and was told no, we don't have a microwave. I've stayed here before in the penthouse which was great and the reason I checked backed in this hotel. This time wasn't so great, I got a standard room. Valet parking attendance was wonderful and welcoming, they did a great job!"

I have always like the soap and shampoo when I stay here too. It's on the bay and upper floors all have nice views.
5985,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2016-06-05T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,4.0,"This was our annual Anniversary Trip Getaway. We had stayed at the IP on one other occasion and enjoyed it. This time it had the best rate available so I chose it. It has a nice rooftop pool, good restaurants, nice gaming floor layout, good live music, and is close to the beach. All in all it was perfect for our trip. I would definitely stay here again."
5986,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2016-08-11T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,5.0,I really enjoyed my stay the food was awesome I will definetly be coming back.
5987,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2016-07-01T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,4.0,Our stay with IP was wonderful. The staff were very friendly and the rooms were very well kept up. My only complaint is that IP is not walking distance to the other casinos.
5988,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2016-08-23T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,5.0,"hotel casino resort is nice,but employees watch you like ur a criminal, they dont want u to bring ur own towels to pool an ur not allowed to take pool towels to room so its pain in the blah when u have kids an need to wrap them up to take them from pool to room wet,, then even tho i was with my kids the guards tried to make my kids show id to walk from hotel to pool or parkin lot,,kids arent old enough to have id yet. also the wall socket in room did not work an i asked the bellman about it but he couldnt help then noticed one bed did not have a blanket but when tryin to ask housekeeper she couldnt understand me an i realized she didnt know english..game room arcade needs a major upgrade needs to be non drinking and smoking since it is for the children also needs to be open later, we tried to enjoy the few games in it but had a wad of grown drunk men come in all loud an rough while they climbed on an wrestled on the games,,had to leave to prevent my kids from gettin hurt, those things aside this resort is nice"
5989,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2014-12-13T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,5.0,Everything was perfect. They made the ballroom into a winter wonderland. Teresa helped me through the line to get me a plate of the delicious food and also made sure we had to go boxes to take with us afterward.
5990,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2016-07-10T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,4.0,"Hotel was good, but room we had, air din't cool as good as should. Would have helped considering it was 98 outside. Other than that a few small cleanliness issues in bathroom. But overall really good."
5991,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2016-07-25T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,4.0,"We had a fun time in Biloxi, the hotel was exactly as advertised, the room in the pictures looked EXACTLY like the room we stayed in. The pool area was a little odd to get to as it was on the roof of the parking garage, but the pool is very nice. They absolutely will NOT let you leave the pool area with a pool towel which means you should bring your own unless you want to travel from the parking garage, all the way across the hotel while wet. The Italian restaurant on site is decent and priced well. We had two rooms on the trip, the TV did not work in our second room for two days. The only channel on the TV showed adult programming at night, which meant since their were kids in the room TV was not an option. To be fair, we called the desk about this once, then complained again the evening of the second day and they fixed it right away after the second complain so most likely they simply forgot about it, but this does not reflect well on the staff. The lowest rating I give the hotel is the staff, other than that its a great stay. The main thing that bothered me was telling a 4 year old who stood there shivering that they couldn't take a towel to the room."
5992,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2016-06-20T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,5.0,"I was blown away at how much I enjoyed my stay at IP, even though it was just for one day. I was traveling back home to San Antonio from Orlando, and decided to stop halfway through my trip to get some rest. Never having been to Mississippi, I did have some slight reservations, but when I got to the hotel, everything had changed. The front desk staff were more than friendly, very outgoing, and told me about signing up for a free players card in the casino to get a free buffet upstairs, which by the way was AMAZING. All the food and desserts were awesome, and my server was lovely. The room was extremely clean, bed was comfy, and shower was good. To sum it up, if I am ever to take another road trip through the south, I will stop at IP! Thank you so much for everything! :)"

6008,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2016-06-19T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,2.0,"We wanted a king bed and was told we had a room with 2 queens. The desk rep was very condescending when she said the king was based on availability and since I had only made my reservation 12 days ago, I was probably on the bottom of the list. There was a long line to get into the 2 available elevators to go to floors 16 to 32. There are actually 3 elevators but one was stopped on the 2nd floor the entire time. Poor planning to only have 2 available at check in. To get to the pool, you have to either walk all across the lobby or through part of the casino to get to the elevator. Pool area was dirty with cigarette butts."

Not enough attendendants at peek times. Attendendants didn't want to direct traffic if it entailed getting in the sun to eplain where entering cars had to go. They preferred to to stay under the canopy and the entering guess we're left unattended in the drive. Poor service there. Enter for check in and line was long, that's expected. But only 6 agents to handle the crowd is why there was a back up. IP is a nice place. Great pool area. Resort fees for a hotel in Mississippi(it's just a hotel in Mississippi) I was there for a concert, the room was prepaid. Then the hotel changed the date of the concert and charged me more to change the date of my stay. That I'd say was poor judgment on their part. I explained when changing the reservation that it was IP's fault that the dates changed. That didn't matter to them. They gladly charged me another 33 dollars per night. Plus resort fees. Fool me once."

There was no coffee pot thus no way to make coffee. And the biggest annoyance was there was no Water in the room and a vending machine in the hall with 3.00 a bottle water. Really. Charging for drinking water and NOTHING available in the room. Absolute worst on room amenities for a Casino Hotel. I stayed one night.......dropped a few hundred in the Casino and you couldn't provide drinking water in my room. I probably wouldn't return, as I was unimpressed."

6057,Ip Casino Resort Spa,Biloxi,2016-10-16T00:00:00Z,30.411692,-88.890249,5.0,"I have stayed at the IP three times in the past few years ... and EVERY time has been AMAZING! At check in, the employees smile and seem happy to be there, making sure to explain any additional charges that may apply during the stay. On my most recent visit, they printed a new player's card at the check-in counter for me, and replaced my husband's card too. The view from the room was of the ocean ... while yes, it is a ways away, there isn't much in Biloxi, and from our floor (20th) we were able to see it clearly. We always eat at the HighTide restaurant at least once every visit and this time was AMAZING. Since our last visit, I was placed on a restrictive diet and the HighTide was very accomodating to my insane requests. I had the fish of the day (Tilapia backened) and it was melt in your mouth fabulous. My husband said that his All American Breakfast hit the spot for him too. The casino isn't always friendly to us, but our luck is better here than at any other casino in either Vegas or Biloxi. We typically have one bad day followed by one REALLY good one. ... and we go home breaking even. And hey, we had the chance at the jackpot. :) The servers could use a wardrobe update ... I am not a fan of the exposed bra behind a corset top ... but asside from the atrocious attire, they are SUPER friendly and attentive. Of course, just like anywhere else, generous tipping will keep them coming around more often .... especially when you're drinking non-alcoholic beverages. :) Check out was easy and stress free as well ... and Juana, our room attendant, did a wonderful job on our last visit. I left her a tip when we left because she was awesome enough to leave us some extra coffee and creamer upon request. I will never stay anywhere else."

The fire alarm kept going off on other floors and we would get closed in by the fire doors with no idea of what was going on until they would announce that we could go on with our normal activities. Coffee shop employees are very rude and obviously hate their job. Only plus to our trip was the pool staff and quench bar employees are wonderful.

First of all, we arrived a little early and wanted to go to the park. We were told a room was ready, but we'd have to pay a 25 early check in (what the heck!) Never heard of this before. We decided to pay because we wanted to go on the park for the day and wanted to get the food water out of the hot car. Also, the room wasn't exactly clean... It was cleanish, but not exactly clean... The hotel ice machines were broken, then we were sent to the office (per housekeeping) to get ice, and they were out... Not cool. It was a hot weekend, and all of their ice machines weren't working Hmmm... Their continental breakfast was terrible. All they had was undercooked waffles, two kinds of cereal, tiny muffins and bread for toast... All carbs... no protein whatsoever, and no fruit. Not exactly a healthy breakfast. The whole hotel looked awful. They definitely need to invest money into their hotel to make it look smell better. Sadly, that was our last stay at this Travelodge. We stayed at the Super 8 down the road recently, they at least offer fruit and yogurt for breakfast (along with a variety of other pastries, waffles, and cereals), and they're in the process of remodeling. We'll be staying there from now on."

I advised the hotel staff about the leak and was told they will have someone there to fix the same day. I was there for three nights and it was never fixed. The shower water pressure was very low and came out as a drizzle. The temperature fluctuated while taking a shower as well from cold to very hot and to cold again. The bed felt very lopsided. The pillows where old and collapsing and smashed. There was little flying nats or bugs flying around in the room. I will never stay there again and will advise all those that I know and don't know to not stay there as well.

Pool and spa not working was looking forward to a swim. That's why I got this hotel over another one. Very unhappy overall. Staff talked down to me. I feel it was an age thing but I have been traveling with my family all over the world since I was 6 months old so I am a experienced traveler.

I have stayed there many times with no problems but this last stay was a nightmare. I went to check out and obtain my deposit the front desk sent someone to my room to check it. I was then told I would not get my deposit back because the room smelt like Marijuana. Not smoke but Marijuana. I am 5 months pregnant and had my two year old son in the room. They noticed my husband smoking outside of the room in my car and assumed he was smoking in the room. I was crying and furious about losing my 200 deposit. I was told they wouldn't be able to rent the room out yesterday after we left because of the smell, we'll guess what the room was occupied when I called last night so where did my deposit go"
6126,Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,Anaheim,2016-05-16T00:00:00Z,33.796738,-117.915091,1.0,They gave another guest a key that opened my room. That guest opened my room in the middle of the night scaring my family. The gust then told me that gave us the wrong key. So disappointed!

Was too dim for makeup application and carpets felt dirty so I had 2 wear sandles if I walked. Overall, clean room."

I did not get all the advertised amenities, i.e microwave oven, refrigerator, pool access. Guests and sou rounding areas were noisy (with building's construction noise all night long). On the other hand, attendants were courteous and helpful. Overall, yes it's just a two star place but it could be easily turn into a three stars for a happy return when planning on visiting Anaheim's Convention Center or the Disney park."

Rooms are clean comfortable, a little dated ,but for price and proximity to Disney it's great. Had no problems feeling un safe, breakfast is a nice touch staff makes you fresh waffles on request. Only bad things are it's a little noise and in parking lot Someone vomited near our car splashing all over it. Other than that hotel was fine gets the job done."

Wasn't to happy that there weren't any toothbrushes supplied. Pillows are half the size of regular pillows, but they give you 4 of them. Complimentary breakfast left little to be desired, but there's a Denny's next door. Overall, didn't spend too much time in the hotel as most of the trip was spent in Disneyland, but I would definitely return to this hotel for the price and convenience."
6135,Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,Anaheim,2016-06-21T00:00:00Z,33.796738,-117.915091,1.0,Not the first time I've stayed here. Probably our 5/6th time. Three rooms to get it right. First one didn't lock second didn't have a working tv. Washer stained my clothes bc it clearly didn't rinse or spin properly and dryer ate my money. Didn't complain about washer bc hey it happens but dryer ate my 8 quarters and hotel staff did not believe me. What would I get out of lying not to mention I got all my quarters for my one load from the front desk.

6139,Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,Anaheim,2016-05-29T00:00:00Z,33.796738,-117.915091,3.0,"The location was great, but the room was much less then to be desired. Upon arrival at the front desk, you receive a welcoming from the staff, the front desk/reception area has clearly had a renovation, so I got the feeling that the rooms would be just as nice. When I got to my room, I was not pleasantly surprised, most of the fixtures were very worn and needed a major facelift. The bathroom was clean but the dressing area was disgusting, I didn't even want to use the sink, there was crud around the handles and the spicket was full of hard water build up, there was no water pressure, which isn't unheard of, but I would expect to be able to rinse my hair in a timely manner. Floors were beyond disgusting, (wear shoes at all times) and the bed linens were just as I expected, the sheets were clean but the covers were reused. Overall not a bad place, I've stayed in worse, happy I was only there to rest, but the few amenities they had could have been updated, for the price, I would assume they are getting ready to renovate, at least I really hope so. The location is great and close to everything, the bus for Disney is outside the hotel and takes you right to the front."

I am so glad I was the one to get burnt first and not my kids or you'd be getting more than just a bad review! Also, we stayed when it was 109 degrees outside and the pool was out of order the entire time... get your s!t together! We ended up leaving early and staying at the best western next door which I highly recommend!"
6141,Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,Anaheim,2016-07-11T00:00:00Z,33.796738,-117.915091,3.0,"This hotel requires a deposit prior to staying when you check in. 100 with credit, or 200 paying cash. We had no idea this was required and it put a dent in our financial plans for our trip. Also, the parking spaces are SMALL. We own a mini van and were called at 1am to move our car so someone else could park next to us. We had 2 babies with us which we felt was extremely rude to wake up. My husband moved it an inch and when we woke up the next morning, a truck parked so close we couldn't get in and said truck had no parking permit. Lastly, when checking out, we weren't even asked how our stay was."

For the price I paid for and what came included-- WiFi and breakfast, it was worth the cost as I wasn't looking for much in high end amenities. The toilet basin wasn't filling up and was causing some flushing issues. Front desk was made aware of it and resolved it after I checked out. I was literally here for 12 hours and no complaints. And it was quiet."

6146,Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,Anaheim,2016-07-19T00:00:00Z,33.796738,-117.915091,3.0,A bit far from Disneyland to walk.

She offered me a non-hotel pen,so I asked for a Travelodge Pen...Also, when I checked in, the desk clerk told me I could use the Pool their sister hotel, Ramada Inn,,but it to was closed for repairs maintenance... So Ghetto,,,"
6149,Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,Anaheim,2016-06-23T00:00:00Z,33.796738,-117.915091,3.0,"Overall, the Travelodge wasn't bad, this biggest issue was the 100 hold placed on my card at the beginning of the stay that I was not told about beforehand, and then the 3 day wait to get it cleared after checkout. This was already a budgeted vacation and that was not expected."
6150,Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,Anaheim,2016-05-30T00:00:00Z,33.796738,-117.915091,2.0,"The Good: Price was cheap (70/night). The hotel is a convenient 10 minute walk to the Disney Toy Story parking lot. Leave your car at the hotel and save 18/day parking fee with an easy 10 minute walk to the Disney Toy Story parking lot at S Harbor and Convention to catch the free shuttle to Disneyland and Disney's California Adventure. There are several restaurants nearby (Denny's right next door) and the area seems quite safe. The Bad: I've never stayed in a hotel room that was so dirty. I should say filthy. Carpet is in desperate need of replacement and leaves stains on your socks. Dental floss in sink, which had the drain stopper out on the counter and was clogged. Work was going on in the next door room (hammering) until I went next door to ask them when they planned to stop around 9p. The Ugly: I stayed at this place despite the fact the room was very dirty."

6154,Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,Anaheim,2016-05-15T00:00:00Z,33.796738,-117.915091,1.0,The first hiccup in this stay was the desk clerk not handling the deposit correctly. It was very confusing and he kept changing the rules. First it was 100 cash or card. Then it was 200 cash or 100 on card. Then the room was horrible. The ceiling was extremely stained and some of the popcorn texture was falling. The bed was very uncomfortable. The a/c did work well and the breakfast was good.
6155,Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,Anaheim,2016-07-06T00:00:00Z,33.796738,-117.915091,3.0,"We chose this hotel for the breakfast. We had stayed here before and it was great. On this trip the breakfast was sorely lacking. There were only waffles (passed out by an attendant who gave ours to another guest twice), not so great pastries and cereal. We weren't expecting 5 star caliber, but we were expecting what we had experienced before. We won't stay again."
6156,Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,Anaheim,2016-05-27T00:00:00Z,33.796738,-117.915091,5.0,It was bit pricey for a motel but taking into consideration the location (about 1/2 a mile from Disneyland) it was worth it.

6157,Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,Anaheim,2016-05-19T00:00:00Z,33.796738,-117.915091,1.0,"While the location is great as it has free parking and is located within walking distance to one of the Disney parking areas with a free shuttle, that was about the only thing remarkable about this hotel. The room was dated and had the bare minimum done to make it worth sleeping in. Continental breakfast did have fresh waffles but other than than, toast, cereal, juice and milk were about all that was offered to go with it. Fortunately, there is a Denny's right next door. They may be doing some remodeling but what we saw on our stay was not enough to make me want to stay there again. Room price was relatively cheap compared to many others but worth it to pay more for a decent place to sleep."

The room showed a broken into room door which was poorly repaired. The curtains had holes in them from age. The bathroom and towels were just as old and dirty with the water turning cold and hot and cold again in the shower. Add the old CRT TV and my conclusion was the owners are just interested in maximizing profits at the expense of its boarders. The front facade looks great but the hotel is run down. May be worth 50.00 per night at the most.

Overall, this hotel is our absolute favorite place to be when we visit Disney. It is a slightly longer walk (20-25 minutes) than most people would like, but the value added here is definitely worth an extra ten minutes of walking. First, the service here is wonderful. The front desk is always very helpful and willing to accommodate requests. They also have free parking and free breakfast, and the breakfast actually has options and enough food to cover an entire meal. It is not a grab and go style to gives you a mini muffin and cup of coffee, but actually allows you and your family a free meal that also helps with budgeting trips. Also, we have always enjoyed the rooms and never had an issue with cleanliness. The beds are comfy and the in-room mini fridge and coffee makers are great. It is a little noisy, but simply leaving the fan on gives enough white noise to be able to sleep. To anyone looking for a budget friendly option that is still close enough to the parks that you can walk every day, this is definitely worth checking out!"

The carpet and corners of the carpets were filthy. You could see where items like the door lock, shower rod, and toilet paper holders had come down and then replaced without spackling and repairing of the wall. On the last night we were locked out of our room because the computerized door lock wouldn't read anyone's door card, even the management's card, and they knew all day that it needed fixed. It was not worth the price per night that we paid. The only perk were that the beds were comfortable, parking was free, and there was free wifi."

6189,Travelodge Anaheim Convention Center,Anaheim,2016-10-11T00:00:00Z,33.796738,-117.915091,2.0,"My friends and I stayed 3 nights at the Travelodge for our trip to Disneyland. It was about a mile walk but right next to a Denny's which was convenient. The room itself was very outdated and the beds were uncomfortable. We were looking forward to using the pool area, but of course it was closed (for repairs). The people in the room next to us were very loud throughout the night and in the morning which was annoying. The fridge and microwave worked well. The shower was not very clean and the water temperature was either very hot or luke warm depending on the time of the day. The wifi did not work well, so we couldn't even really use it. Luckily, the outdated TV (not a flat screen) did have some great channels. Last but not least, the complimentary breakfast was a couple different cereals, small muffins (not good), and waffles with watered down syrup. We only went to eat there the first morning because it wasn't worth going. Overall, if you're just looking for somewhere to crash after a long day in Anaheim, then this place is great for the price but don't expect much."

Literally bare minimum hotel! Just a place to sleep and shower only! 1 block to Disneyland, crazy cheap prices! That's the advantage of staying here. No pool!! You will see one.. it's filled and looks ok.. but cannot use..Overall, I would compare to bare minimum hostel! It is slightly better than sleeping in your car! Props for free wifi... weak, but still free.."

Pool and hot tub were closed for repair which was a bummer! Free continental breakfast wasn't the greatest, but ok. Room was huge and really nice. King size bed was very comfortable. AC worked great and kept us nice and cool. Would probably stay there again because of great price."

We were on the 3rd floor. The room was dirty, there wasn't any coffee cups or water cups. the roof had water damage. the door was not sealed and the sunlight came in long with the heat. the shower head was like a slow drip if you wanted to rinse you needed to fill the tub and rinse this way. Went down to get coffee and something to eat. The ladies there spoke Spanish very little English made two cups of coffee when doing so read how I could not leave with anything and go back to my room. walked over to make a waffle and the Spanish lady ran over and started yelling at me no, no, no I make these and pointed at the sign. Ah ok then you might want to stay over there lady and keep your post. There was no fruit very little to choose from. took coffee cups to my room and didn't care what they had to say about it, I would have reminded them they didn't do a great job on the room as it wasn't clean and ready for the guess. Will not ever be coming back to this place and would not refer anyone to stay here. Wyndem owns this place and it was a big reminder why we didn't go into points with them. they don't care how it looks just wants your money."

We discovered this when we tried to use it. The breakfast area was also closed. We discovered that our first morning here. There was a paper arrow taped on the locked breakfast area door that pointed toward the dumpster across the parking lot. My family scoured the area but found no alternative breakfast room. It was 6:15 in the morning and the front desk was closed so we ended up going to Denny's next door. Our toilet kept running when flushed so I had to open up the back, stick my hand in and correct the problem."

We were welcomed with a friendly front desk receptionist. Beds were comfy. Room was quite spacious, although needs to be updated. However, extremely clean. The only thing we delt with was our bathroom fan kinda had a mind of its own, it would come on and turn off when it wanted to, which wasn't a big deal for us at all. The room we were in was on the first floor facing the parking lot and three rooms away from the dinning area and it was super quiet! Even though we didn't use this feature, the hotel surprisingly had room service!! However, there is a Dennis restaurant right next door. It was a 5 Uber ride from Disneyland to the hotel."

The girl at the desk was not very friendly and people could find the way she spoke rude. They ask you for 100 on a credit card or 200 cash. It for damages to the room. Like to grown responsible middle age men are going to damage the place really. On a good note the breakfast is great they provide waffles, cereal, juices, coffee and toast including mini muffins."

The linens on one of the beds were used and dirty, had not been replaced. There were lots of maintenance issues in the room, holes in the walls, missing fiextures etc. The staff was rude, the desk clerk was very short, and discurteous at checkout, and a member of the cleaning staff was extreamly rude. As we were leaving our room, she cut my wife and son off, telling them to, and i quote, move. The breakfast was horrible as well. Theye were out of several things, the waffless they prepared for the guests were overcooked, and the milk was either old, tainted, or there was something altering the taste in the dispense, it was inedible.

It's not the best hotel out there, but you get what you pay for. A room close to Disneyland that's not going to break your bank. Disneyland and California Adventure are within walking distance, but there are two shuttles nearby that can take you straight there. The room was quaint, a little dated, but again you get what you pay for. All in all our stay was great and the hotel workers were very helpful."

There are plenty of well-known brands with properties near the airport (including this one). Most of them look about the same online. I picked this one as a budget option and was a bit surprised at how good it was. I've stayed at nice 4 and 5-star hotels and you wouldn't mistake this property for one of those but the staff was helpful, the free breakfast was solid (and the selection rotated), there was coffee in the lobby, and the housekeeping staff was really good (for example, I returned to my room to find my toothbrush, razor, and comb arranged on folded washcloth in the bathroom -not something I'd expect at this price point). It's at the airport so I wouldn't recommend it as a vacation hotel but if you're coming to Tucson for business or want something clean and affordable near the airport, this is a great choice."

Lighting in the room and especially in the bathroom was poor - but it usually is in hotels now with energy-saving bulbs. The breakfast was good and plentiful and the staff was pleasant and helpful. Overall a good experience.

For the price we paid we felt it was a very good value. The breakfast is typical of a Hampton Inn and just right. Not too fancy, not too plain. Would stay again.

It's within walking distance to at least three restaurants/bars. The room was clean. We had a toilet flushing problem that was fixed quickly. The bed linens were white and clean, but the mattress felt kind of old. The breakfast was good though it had a lot of white bread, white sugar options (to be fair there was fruit and eggs)."

Was most comfortable when we just turned it off. The bathroom was small, very dark and very outdated. The complementary breakfast was especially nice. There was a great variety of options and the lobby area where the breakfast was served was comfortable and very nicely decorated. It didn't ever work for us to be there for the complimentary happy hour but we appreciated that it was offered. Despite being near the airport we were never aware of any noise from planes. Most of the hotel staff was very friendly and helpful."

6288,Hampton Inn Tucson-airport,Tucson,2016-06-18T00:00:00Z,32.124926,-110.934519,3.0,"I knew from the beginning that the place was not close to the main areas of Tucson, although it is close to the airport, so I can't complain about that. I guess is convenient if you are flying. I chose this hotel for the price and because it was not so far from Casino del Sol. Place is good for the price, breakfast is not that bad for a free one. Coffee was great tough. The room was clean but the furniture seems kind of old. Room was quiet although sometimes when other room's door was closing or opening it seemed like it was ours. Pool was not clean, there are several trees around it and a lot of leaves were on it and also there were bees and wasps around the pool, some of them fell on it. Needs more attention. Staff was nice although we did not interact much other than check in check out, and requested more towels. Like I said, it is ok if you need to go to the airport, and price is good. I probably would not stay again on this hotel or any of the hotels in the area unless I am flying."

The bed is very comfortable, and the breakfast has a good variety, including lots of fruit. It is dark and quiet in the room (ie you can't hear other doors opening and closing). My only criticism is that it is very hot at night, and you can't turn the thermostat below 65. Also, you might hear airplanes take off in the morning, but that's true of any hotel near the airport."

Now that the renovations are complete, I found the hotel nicely updated. The breakfast, as usual, was a nice plus and the shuttle service very helpful."

6400,Hampton Inn Tucson-airport,Tucson,2016-01-07T00:00:00Z,32.124926,-110.934519,5.0,We've stayed here numerous times and every time it has been great. The rooms are always very very clean and everything is new and updated. Always great rates too with a very nice complimentary breakfast in the morning with numerous items to choose from.

Beds are good and staff MOST helpful and appreciated. Pillows have gotten a bit lumpy though - might check this out, as you normally have the best linens."
6402,Hampton Inn Tucson-airport,Tucson,2015-12-28T00:00:00Z,32.124926,-110.934519,5.0,A very nice facility and very close easy access to the airport. The property is well run by a professional and friendly staff. Great breakfast...the eggs and bacon actually tasted like eggs and bacon! The shuttle service is excellent and fast. The rooms are comfortable and reasonably appointed.

6406,Hampton Inn Tucson-airport,Tucson,2016-01-12T00:00:00Z,32.124926,-110.934519,3.0,"First, in fairness, we were on site for only about 4 hrs. We had arrived late and had a very early morning flight. The room was nice and clean but very small. For one night, it was fine but even if I was by myself, I think I would feel a little hemmed in after more than just a couple... More"
6407,Hampton Inn Tucson-airport,Tucson,2016-07-25T00:00:00Z,32.124926,-110.934519,5.0,"Loved my room, very spacious! Hotel staff went above and beyond! I needed something urgent printed off my phone and they took care of it right away!"
6408,Hampton Inn Tucson-airport,Tucson,2016-07-11T00:00:00Z,32.124926,-110.934519,3.0,"This is a nice, clean hotel. The staff member at check-in was a snob. I am a rewards member but felt like it wasn't good enough for her that I was only the first level member. However, the staff the next day was much better. Breakfast is worth skipping."
6409,Hampton Inn Tucson-airport,Tucson,2015-12-04T00:00:00Z,32.124926,-110.934519,5.0,"This hotel was lovely. The personnel was helpful, once they explained the bizarre nature of the heating/cooling system (heat was pouring out of the unit because a chair blocked the unit from being seen by the thermostat). Comfortable bed and delicious breakfast, and the location was convenient."
6410,Hampton Inn Tucson-airport,Tucson,2016-08-11T00:00:00Z,32.124926,-110.934519,5.0,"If you are looking for a good place to stay when you are going in out (quick trip) of Tucson, the Holiday Inn at the Airport is the place. No issues with room, clean, comfortable, wifi worked well, no waiting time for check-in, breakfast, and next to airport."
6411,Palm Suites,Atlantic Beach,2016-06-12T00:00:00Z,34.701386,-76.74691,3.0,The place was okay...it was kept clean. The main problem was our room was always hot. We would be out all day and want to come back to cool off and the room would be hot. We did enjoy the area though.
6412,Palm Suites,Atlantic Beach,2016-06-10T00:00:00Z,34.701386,-76.74691,1.0,I asked if it was ocean and was told it was on the beach. I asked for a room for three adults and it was more like a child's room. I feel like I was deceived.
6413,Palm Suites,Atlantic Beach,2016-05-26T00:00:00Z,34.701386,-76.74691,5.0,My husband and I went down for a 4 day getaway. I was disappointed that I wasnt able to get a room on the ocean but The Palms made up for it. It was by far the cleanest room I have ever stayed in. The staff was so friendly and nice. The bed was super comfy and the hotel itself was very welcoming. I will definitely stay there again.
6414,Palm Suites,Atlantic Beach,2016-08-12T00:00:00Z,34.701386,-76.74691,3.0,"Had a short stay. Air conditioner was loud but kept room comfortable on super hot day. Staff was not very friendly but was efficient. Is a non smoking hotel but has an area off property for smokers. No shade, no ashtray, so nasty and butts all over the ground."
6415,Palm Suites,Atlantic Beach,2016-07-07T00:00:00Z,34.701386,-76.74691,5.0,The stay was comfortably quiet and close to shopping.
6416,Palm Suites,Atlantic Beach,2016-07-07T00:00:00Z,34.701386,-76.74691,4.0,I enjoyed everything two tvs only one worked air conditioning louder than tv was
6417,Palm Suites,Atlantic Beach,2016-04-12T00:00:00Z,34.701386,-76.74691,4.0,"Stayed 2 nights, very enjoyable."
6418,Palm Suites,Atlantic Beach,2016-03-25T00:00:00Z,34.701386,-76.74691,3.0,The rooms/suite at this hotel are individually owned and therefore NOT all rooms are created equally!!! Our room was very 'tired' looking in terms of decor. Curtains bedding could do with updating and the room would definitely benefit from a fresh coat of paint and some fresh updated wall art. The room was just 'OK' and worked out for a one night stay. We were dissaponted that the pool was not yet open as they were waiting on the state inspector to sign off. On chatting with the house keeper as cleaned the room next to ours she invited us to see inside. The room was slightly larger with two double beds (same as our room) but had the benefit of a sofa coffee table seating area. Bed linens were bright and modern looking. Very nice. I guess it's the luck of the draw as to which room you are assigned!
6419,Palm Suites,Atlantic Beach,2016-03-30T00:00:00Z,34.701386,-76.74691,4.0,Although currently being renovated our stay was very pleasant. Customer service was friendly. Plan on visiting again!

6421,Palm Suites,Atlantic Beach,2016-03-25T00:00:00Z,34.701386,-76.74691,4.0,We had agreat weekend only problem was we booked for kingsize and was put in a double bed suite. Tub needed updated. Everything else was good. Will book again next time check suite out before unpacking. Clean and home away from home.
6422,Palm Suites,Atlantic Beach,2016-07-16T00:00:00Z,34.701386,-76.74691,4.0,For one nights stay this hotel was nice. Only complaint was the bed closest to the balcony in room 217 was extremely squeaky and noisy when you'd roll over. Hard to get a good sleep in a squeaky bed.
6423,Palm Suites,Atlantic Beach,2016-08-06T00:00:00Z,34.701386,-76.74691,2.0,"One-nighter moved to Doubletree the next day (existing reservation). Remember this one from waaaaaaaaay back in the day when it was Days Inn. NO elevators. Room smelled dank. No bar soap or shampoo. Little fridge was half-cold and REEKED of fish. Carpet felt damp. Visible black mold in the box surrounding the a/c unit. Mold around the bathroom 'vent'(which vents nowhere). Pool-deck was vinyl over wood-framing, and was soft and giving way in a couple places. My understanding is these places are individually-owned under one management company, with a HOA. Be advised, it sure seems like a time-share.... only primitive. This facility is at a turning-point: it either needs a massive infusion of cash and renovation, or it needs to 'give way'. My head says demo, my heart says reno."
6424,Palm Suites,Atlantic Beach,2016-06-25T00:00:00Z,34.701386,-76.74691,4.0,It was comfy and nice. But the bed was uncomfortable. We could feel the springs. Didn't sleep well!
6425,Palm Suites,Atlantic Beach,2016-06-11T00:00:00Z,34.701386,-76.74691,3.0,"We were in town for a friend's wedding weekend. Called ahead to see about early check-in and the staff were accommodating! Hotel was undergoing some renovations before the busier summer season, so some noise and taped-off areas. Found two cockroaches in our room unfortunately! AC, TV, a fine place to rest your head, but kinda felt like you get what you pay for rang true."
6426,Palm Suites,Atlantic Beach,2016-04-22T00:00:00Z,34.701386,-76.74691,4.0,My wife and I had a long weekend with my new boat. We picked out the Palms because the are on a canal and have boat slips. We had a second floor overlooking the marsh. Great view and sunset. Staff was very helpful.
6427,Palm Suites,Atlantic Beach,2016-07-08T00:00:00Z,34.701386,-76.74691,4.0,"Really enjoyed my stay. The hotel is very roomy and i love the rooms. Its right near the beach so that was convenient, would definitely stay again!"
6428,Palm Suites,Atlantic Beach,2016-04-22T00:00:00Z,34.701386,-76.74691,5.0,Will definitely stay there again when I'm in town. Staff was very friendly!
6429,Palm Suites,Atlantic Beach,2016-03-25T00:00:00Z,34.701386,-76.74691,5.0,We had a great time! We will definitely come back again!!
6430,Palm Suites,Atlantic Beach,2016-07-24T00:00:00Z,34.701386,-76.74691,4.0,"The room was very nice. Outside of place needs to be cleaned up and repaired. Pool was needing repair. Very nice staff. Clean room and decor very pretty. Not an ocean view, but can go out on pier to watch the sunset and fish and crab. Good location for beach access but it is a walk."
6431,Palm Suites,Atlantic Beach,2016-06-04T00:00:00Z,34.701386,-76.74691,1.0,Horrible place. They ran out of parking spaces somehow so I parkwd in the rocks. Still on there property and they had it towed. They should have had someone elses car towed not mine.
6432,Palm Suites,Atlantic Beach,2016-05-19T00:00:00Z,34.701386,-76.74691,3.0,"Volunteered to work an event at local airport. Hotel much better and dryer than a tent. Just needed a clean bed and bathroom. Friend stayed on pull out bed instead of a tent in the rain. He liked the dry accpmidations, TV and bathroom. However the pullout coach was less comfortable than the ground."
6433,Palm Suites,Atlantic Beach,2016-05-07T00:00:00Z,34.701386,-76.74691,4.0,Nice value
6434,Palm Suites,Atlantic Beach,2016-06-09T00:00:00Z,34.701386,-76.74691,5.0,"Beautiful room, decorated very nice! Extremely comfy beds with lots of pillows. Most importantly, the room was perfectly clean!"
6435,Palm Suites,Atlantic Beach,2016-07-22T00:00:00Z,34.701386,-76.74691,4.0,We have stayed at Palm Suites for years but this particular time our room was not exactly what we had Asfoor website had us down for a king bed but it was only a queen also advertised a laundry mat which we did not have which really inconvenienced me because we were there for a baseball we love the hotel the. We we love the hotel the pier the pool but I was just really disappointed about the smaller bed and laundry . The bathroom was just too small and hot. And there was no closet had to hang clothes on curtain rod .
6436,Palm Suites,Atlantic Beach,2016-07-20T00:00:00Z,34.701386,-76.74691,5.0,"Drove little over 4 hours to spend the afternoon and night at the beach!! It was well worth it! The room was impeccable, the staff went above and beyond to accommodate a situation,absolutely a divine stay!!"
6437,Palm Suites,Atlantic Beach,2016-09-16T00:00:00Z,34.701386,-76.74691,2.0,"When checked into room, pizza box was in there. Management notified and they came to clean. Did not clean, just removed boxes. After spending Saturday running around and getting back late, went straight to bed, NO box spring underneath, lumps, apparently the mattress are very very old. Underneath one bed was a wine bottle stopper and popcorn. These were not noticed due to bed linens covered the mess. Checking out Sunday and advised staff at front desk and she said sorry and lookedo at use like we should not have said anything. Tried calling four 4 hours Sunday night, no answer. If not for location, nothing good can be said, as far as I'm concerned"
6438,Palm Suites,Atlantic Beach,2016-04-27T00:00:00Z,34.701386,-76.74691,3.0,The sheets felt like sandpaper and bed sunk down in the middle terribly. It was a beautiful room. Nice place and employees if you could find them.
6439,Palm Suites,Atlantic Beach,2016-07-15T00:00:00Z,34.701386,-76.74691,5.0,Only bad thing is if you have a problem with stairs there's no elevator
6440,Palm Suites,Atlantic Beach,2016-04-24T00:00:00Z,34.701386,-76.74691,5.0,The service staff was excellent Room was perfect Very spacious Very clean And will recommend it to anyone
6441,Palm Suites,Atlantic Beach,2016-06-17T00:00:00Z,34.701386,-76.74691,3.0,"Lovely stay. However, room 214 could use some updating."
6442,Palm Suites,Atlantic Beach,2016-07-29T00:00:00Z,34.701386,-76.74691,3.0,"The rooms were decorated in a fun way that my daughter enjoyed. The staff was very friendly eager to fix problems. The pool was nice and clean, but small.The walls are very thin and when the air conditioner stops you can hear everything in the halls and neighboring rooms. The bed was very uncomfortable. Unfortunately, a lot of the cute decor was falling apart, and nothing except the bedding felt very clean. The halls and stairwells were pretty dirty and don't seem to get cleaned, also have quite a musty smell. The wifi never connected and we had to go outside of the hotel to get reception for Internet. The ice and drink machines broke down while we were there, but the staff did jump on it trying to fix it quickly. Ok for a couple of nights, but honestly for the money we spent we could have stayed at other spots closer to the shore and more updated."
6443,Palm Suites,Atlantic Beach,2016-05-31T00:00:00Z,34.701386,-76.74691,4.0,"Looked alittle dated, was still nice minus the hair in the bathtub"
6444,Palm Suites,Atlantic Beach,2016-06-09T00:00:00Z,34.701386,-76.74691,4.0,"Room was small, but clean. Bathroom was also small. Laundry room was being remodeled, so no washer or dryer and had to drive 3 miles to wash clothes. Great location and staff was friendly."
6445,Palm Suites,Atlantic Beach,2016-06-10T00:00:00Z,34.701386,-76.74691,5.0,"The hotel was unimpressive from the parking lot, however, when you walked in and made it to your room it was outstanding! Almost had a BB feel with tailored wall hangings and a very home-like kind of feel. Views from the sound side balcony were beautiful. One downfall of the area...cops. We arrived in the area around 9pm and literally saw 10-15 squad cars in a variety of areas, lights flashing, harassing either people walking down the street or people in their vehicles. We actually thought something big had gone down by the sheer number of cops. The next day our family pulled out of the hotel and had driven no more than a mile when a cop stuck his head out of his squad car looking at us, flipped a u-turn and ran a red light at excessive speeds with his lights on to pull us over...for a seatbelt. After receiving the 170 ticket we left the area and went back to Topsail for the day. Absolutely loved the hotel, but probably will avoid the area in the future because of the cops."
6446,Palm Suites,Atlantic Beach,2016-05-19T00:00:00Z,34.701386,-76.74691,1.0,Hotel was not up to date with today's standards. 2 stories but no elevator. Our room did not have a closet and lighting was inadequate. Air conditioner was very loud. Refrigerator doors on wrong side - hard to access. Each unit is individually owned and furnished. Hotel staff used this as an excuse for any complaint. More details need to be listed in Hotel Amenities so that potential guests can make an informed decision. Could have requested ground floor with closet if had known.
6447,Palm Suites,Atlantic Beach,2016-10-06T00:00:00Z,34.701386,-76.74691,5.0,"I like the Palm Suites. I have stayed there a few times and enjoy it. One point that I think is worth pointing out. There was a hurricane on the way and they were great about taking care of us and keeping us safe. They understood the interruption of vacation, as well. I think it is worth pointing out so, I will say it again, they cared about our safety."
6448,Palm Suites,Atlantic Beach,2016-06-14T00:00:00Z,34.701386,-76.74691,3.0,Had a short stay for fishing trips. Nice.
6449,Palm Suites,Atlantic Beach,2016-06-18T00:00:00Z,34.701386,-76.74691,4.0,"Decent hotel for the money and convenience. Nothing to write home about, but compared to neighboring hotels for the money, it met our needs and provided exactly what we expected. The front desk staff was great!"
6450,Palm Suites,Atlantic Beach,2016-07-05T00:00:00Z,34.701386,-76.74691,3.0,"Asked for early check in, no problem room was ready. Room was clean and just what I felt it should be. Nice pool area and sounside view. Also nice deck area for boat slips and boardwalk."
6451,Palm Suites,Atlantic Beach,2016-05-13T00:00:00Z,34.701386,-76.74691,4.0,"We stayed in room 109. I would not recommend a family stay in the room due to the artwork on the wall (painting of nude lady). Bathroom was small but room was good size. There was a step down to the bed area, so not accessible. No sheers on windows so I was a little paranoid since we were on the bottom floor. Hung up towels in between the panels and it was fine though. Didn't go to the pool so not able to comment on that, no breakfast but they do have coffee. Staff was very nice, location was good."
6452,Palm Suites,Atlantic Beach,2016-07-23T00:00:00Z,34.701386,-76.74691,2.0,Parking is an issue. Outdated. Pricy for what you get
6453,Palm Suites,Atlantic Beach,2016-03-30T00:00:00Z,34.701386,-76.74691,3.0,We were disappointed at the hotel. It did not live up to its rating and was very poor compared to Holiday Inn Express hotels that we have used on our road trip. I would not use it again and would not recommend it.
6454,Palm Suites,Atlantic Beach,2016-04-01T00:00:00Z,34.701386,-76.74691,5.0,Was a super friendly staff and clean comphy super cute beachy room with great sound view and it was very quiet

Walls are extremely thin and we were woken up in the middle of the night by yelling and screaming. Domestic issue where police had to be called. I was not able to sleep well because of the noise level in this hotel but this incident really made me feel uncomfortable. Not really hotel fault...just bad timing with the guests there during our stay."

6460,Palm Suites,Atlantic Beach,2016-05-13T00:00:00Z,34.701386,-76.74691,1.0,"My stay was not pleasant, we were put in a room the first night where construction was going on in room above us. went to front desk after calling an no one answering phone neither time I called, and ask what was going on. the Clerk (guy) stated construction of room above me and no one was suppose to have rented this room. he told us to pack our things and he would have us moved, we did, to find out later, we could not be moved. So the clerk stated he spoke with his manager which he had the contractors to leave so we could get some sleep. and we did after that get some sleep. after moving to our original scheduled room, there then was no lock for the safe so we had to carry everything around with us. Did not understand why this room was given to us, knowing that there was going to be contractors working there all night long. The guy clerk was , I would say, doing all he could possibly do since it was dumped in his lap to take care of."
6461,Palm Suites,Atlantic Beach,2016-05-13T00:00:00Z,34.701386,-76.74691,4.0,Loved our room.

6463,Palm Suites,Atlantic Beach,2016-07-08T00:00:00Z,34.701386,-76.74691,1.0,"The room condition was atrocious. Peeling wallpaper and paint, stains on the bedding, carpet, and bathroom. The beds themselves, were like prison mattresses. A fire alarm started blaring early in the morning, and when it clearly wasn't getting turned off, we decided to get up and go to breakfast. There was no one at the counter. The fire department was outside, as were other guests. When we checked out later and asked about it, the guy seemed totally dismissive about the inconvenience. I would not book this hotel again."
6464,Palm Suites,Atlantic Beach,2016-08-12T00:00:00Z,34.701386,-76.74691,2.0,"Palm Suites was a disappointment. Even though I had my confirmation on my phone, she said I had only one room on reservation. She was able to accommodate us. No elevator needs to be made known. It would have affected my decision."
6465,Palm Suites,Atlantic Beach,2016-05-21T00:00:00Z,34.701386,-76.74691,2.0,"The bathroom was dirty, the wall paper was falling off the walls, the laminate flooring had large gaps and was popping up, the bed was old, the linens didn't fit the bed, their was a broken electrical outlet, the air conditioner wires hung out from the top of the sliding glass door, their were no black out curtains, their was a dirty old curtain hanging from what appeared to be a sort of closet, the walls were so thin, we were asked to turn down the music on our cell phone, the wifi didn't work either."
6466,Palm Suites,Atlantic Beach,2016-04-22T00:00:00Z,34.701386,-76.74691,3.0,Horrible stay out of the two nights me and my husband stayed there for out honeymoon WE were our maids. We had to clean up our room everyday because nobody else would. And when we checked out and told the manager up front she tried to blame it on us like it was our fault. Plain enough we will NOT be coming back to this horrible hotel!
6467,Palm Suites,Atlantic Beach,2016-03-14T00:00:00Z,34.701386,-76.74691,5.0,"My family just came for a few days to get away from reality while my husband had a few days vacation. When we got there the lady that checked us in was amazing. She was able to upgrade me to a different room that had a view, and then help us find good places to eat at around there being that this was our first time in atlantic beach, nc. Great place to stay and the price was great."
6468,Palm Suites,Atlantic Beach,2016-07-15T00:00:00Z,34.701386,-76.74691,3.0,Stay was great! We were able to book our weekend trip last minute. The staff was very friendly and even let us check out late on Sunday so the kids could play in the pool. The bathroom/shower could use updating but other than that it was well work the trip.
6469,Palm Suites,Atlantic Beach,2016-09-17T00:00:00Z,34.701386,-76.74691,5.0,Stayed here for girls weekend away. The room we got was so cute and decorated just like you want a beach place. Would stay here again and highly recommend.
6470,Palm Suites,Atlantic Beach,2016-08-15T00:00:00Z,34.701386,-76.74691,5.0,"Great little place, it's actually hotel sized rooms that are each purchased as real property, just as one would purchase a regular sized condo then rent it out. But it's run as a hotel. So if you had a problem with the hair dryer, as we did, you let the front desk know and they will sort it right away. Interesting concept but still a decent place to stay for a couple."
6471,Palm Suites,Atlantic Beach,2016-07-22T00:00:00Z,34.701386,-76.74691,4.0,We had a great time. The rooms were affordable and clean. It was a short walk to the beach and the neighborhood was decent. There are also some pretty good shops in the area and a handful of excellent restaurants.
6472,Palm Suites,Atlantic Beach,2016-04-17T00:00:00Z,34.701386,-76.74691,2.0,Senior travelers and no elevator available. Parking card had room number on it and I was not comfortable with that. I feel that is a security issue. The rooms had ample facilities but no type of breakfast was offered.
6473,Palm Suites,Atlantic Beach,2016-08-07T00:00:00Z,34.701386,-76.74691,3.0,"My boyfriend and I stayed at Palm Suites for the first time this year. Our room at first glance was fine, but we quickly noticed some issues. Our room and dresser drawers smelled heavily of mildew. The in room phone did not work and the TV power button didn't work well. The toaster oven had not been cleaned. The main room light would not stay on. The mattress had a huge brown stain covering about a quarter of the bed. As if that all wasn't enough, we woke up to a mouse eating our food! He kept us awake for two nights. The staff did give us another room for a night so they could set up mouse traps. The room that we were moved to was in much better condition. It was also very disappointing when we went to wash our clothes in the laundry room. We opened the door to find a empty room without washing machines. The location is decent with it being about a 5 minute walk to the beach. Very close to restaurants. The back of the building is facing the bay, which was beautiful! Since these are privately owned rooms, renter beware! You may have a great experience or something a little closer to what we experienced."
6474,Palm Suites,Atlantic Beach,2016-08-16T00:00:00Z,34.701386,-76.74691,3.0,"I have stayed at Palm Suites three times for one or two nights, as the price is quite reasonable for Atlantic Beach and the rooms have been comfortable. Be advised that the units are privately owned, so there can be a considerable difference in their furnishings and amenities. Management provides linen and toiletries service and housekeeping. The first room I had was nicely furnished, including dishes, flatware and kitchen linens. The second room was sparsely, though adequately furnished for a beach stay, but there was no flatware, glasses, nor kitchen linens. We had to take time to go to the supermarket (fortunately nearby) for paper towels and plastic flatware and cups. Neither was there furniture on the balcony. So, the third time, I had presence of mind to ask about amenities. The personnel were wonderfully patient and took the time to verify everything. If you consult the website, you can view photos of the various units. Do choose a sound side unit the town view units overlook the parking lot. Be advised also that the property is not located on the beach and the nearest public beach access is Durham St. (check a map site) and makes the beach a good 5 block walk. This is a perfectly good place to stay for a night or two, but I would not recommend it for an extended beach vacation."
6475,Palm Suites,Atlantic Beach,2016-10-26T00:00:00Z,34.701386,-76.74691,2.0,The room I was in looked nothing like any of the pictures on the site. It had well worn carpet and the walls had scuffs and marks all over them. It had been cleaned but still had an odor about it. For some reason the heat was on and the heat/AC unit was up near the ceiling and could not be adjusted.
6476,Palm Suites,Atlantic Beach,2016-05-14T00:00:00Z,34.701386,-76.74691,3.0,"Was a quick overnight to meet long time friends.Room 241 Was hoping for waterview and got parking lot. The room was cozy but I think each suite is individually owned as I took a walk around the pier some units had larger tvs than others. It did make it a bit hard to watch a 20 inch from the bed. Bed was super comfy with foam mattress toppers on all three beds. (queen, full bunk and twin bunk). Hotel as whole is a bit outdated and there was mold in the bathrooms. But again it was a quick overnight."
6477,Palm Suites,Atlantic Beach,2016-07-16T00:00:00Z,34.701386,-76.74691,4.0,Great place to sleep perfect location to the beach for a great deal! Room was big enoght for family of 4. Close to grocery store. Parking was tight. We would definitely come me back again!
6478,Palm Suites,Atlantic Beach,2016-03-11T00:00:00Z,34.701386,-76.74691,4.0,"The lady at the front desk was beyond accommodating, she was as nice as could be. The room was huge and had beach character, great for vacation. It was set up for a longer stay, we only slept there but it had a full size fridge and sink in the room. The TV was in the sitting room so not like a hotel where you watch from bed (not a complaint just different) the dock is beautiful to go out on and drink your morning coffee. Super nice grills there for you to use as well."
6479,Palm Suites,Atlantic Beach,2016-08-12T00:00:00Z,34.701386,-76.74691,3.0,"The hotel is showing it's age and carpets need replacing, shower was meh and furnishings need updating but otherwise it was a perfectly comfortable room. Nice TV, little kitchenette with fridge. A bit pricey for the accommodations in my opinion but the location is great."
6480,Palm Suites,Atlantic Beach,2016-07-31T00:00:00Z,34.701386,-76.74691,2.0,"This hotel is in a nice location since it is in walking distance (about 10 minutes) or driving (about 4 minutes) to the public access beach. Unfortunately, the hotel is dated and dingy and dirty. The carpeted floor was damp and gross. Our daughter crawled across the floor and had black knees and hands after doing so. Quite disgusting. The staff were very friendly, and helpful, which was nice. I would not stay here with children especially with toddlers. For the price, I expected much better than a Motel 6 or Super 8."
6481,Palm Suites,Atlantic Beach,2016-07-30T00:00:00Z,34.701386,-76.74691,3.0,"Nice room and decor had a nice stay. Door to room needed work had to slam to close going in and out. Poolside was nice, the walk area a little shaky. Overall I had a good visit"
6482,Palm Suites,Atlantic Beach,2016-09-16T00:00:00Z,34.701386,-76.74691,4.0,"Rooms are nice, except for outdated furniture and fixtures. Staff was friendly and efficient. Reasonably priced for the area, but could use some remodeling."
6483,Palm Suites,Atlantic Beach,2016-04-22T00:00:00Z,34.701386,-76.74691,5.0,"Stayed 3 days, 2 nights. Easy access, peaceful, room is cozy but modern. Kitchen in room, convenient, room service daily and as needed. 2 adults and our 3yr old daughter stayed. We loved it"
6484,Palm Suites,Atlantic Beach,2016-08-19T00:00:00Z,34.701386,-76.74691,5.0,Very pleasant staff the hotel has more of an apartment feel than a hotel. Rooms are decorated beautifully and location very quite and peaceful.
6485,Palm Suites,Atlantic Beach,2016-10-01T00:00:00Z,34.701386,-76.74691,3.0,Overall I feel I got what I payed for. Decent service and comfortable beds at a cheap rate. My room was comfortable but felt a bit cluttered and because it had a door to the room next to it I could hear everything going on in the next room over all night long. They had kids and I am a lite sleeper. The lady behind the desk was nice but she didn't even check my ID and didn't really seem to care when i told her that the phone in my room was broken. The cord just came out of the hand when I went to pick it up. Luckily I didn't need it.
6486,Palm Suites,Atlantic Beach,2016-03-31T00:00:00Z,34.701386,-76.74691,4.0,Nice place. Clean rooms and quiet location.
6487,Palm Suites,Atlantic Beach,2016-07-28T00:00:00Z,34.701386,-76.74691,2.0,"The literature in the room says that this hotel has recently been renovated. I found that our room had water-stained ceiling and dark marks appearing near the wall a/c unit. I also found that the rate for this hotel was over-priced for the value. There was no breakfast offered. There is no elevator - we had several items of baggage that we had to carry. This is not a handicap friendly hotel -no ramps and also no pets. All in all, its ok if there is nothing else available but certainly not a place to spend a vacation."
6488,Palm Suites,Atlantic Beach,2016-08-27T00:00:00Z,34.701386,-76.74691,4.0,Very nice

6491,Palm Suites,Atlantic Beach,2016-09-30T00:00:00Z,34.701386,-76.74691,3.0,The stay was ok but our room had black mold on the ceiling above the air conditioner. I ask for a different room but it was booked for the festival on Friday. The clerk said that she may have one on Saturday but i was never contacted.
6492,Palm Suites,Atlantic Beach,2016-08-08T00:00:00Z,34.701386,-76.74691,3.0,Check in was easy and desk clerk very pleasant. Room on the other hand was a little disappointing. Beds hard and pillows flat and tired looking. Bathroom in need of renovation tub and mold or mildew around lip. Sink stopper didn't work at all. Pool and deck looking a bit tired needs some work.

6496,Palm Suites,Atlantic Beach,2016-09-23T00:00:00Z,34.701386,-76.74691,4.0,"We really liked our room. The layout was great, bed couch comfortable, kitchenette well stocked with amenities. Both the beach and the intercoastal waterway were within easy walking distance. The Staff was friendly and willing to help. The only real complaint we had was that the floors needed a thorough cleaning (carpet had probably not been shampooed in some time)."
6497,Palm Suites,Atlantic Beach,2016-09-14T00:00:00Z,34.701386,-76.74691,1.0,"We did not stay at the hotel. There were bugs in the room and we left. We were unable to open the balcony, and the facility did not look like it did on the website. We had not been on a vacation for a while, so I was total disappointed Waterbugs or roaches are not my cup of tea."
6498,Palm Suites,Atlantic Beach,2016-08-08T00:00:00Z,34.701386,-76.74691,4.0,"Enjoyed the room, beach and parking under the garage out of the sun."
6499,Palm Suites,Atlantic Beach,2016-07-22T00:00:00Z,34.701386,-76.74691,3.0,Decent place to stay...shower had tons of long hairs all over the walls and a pile in the drain. The only way you could have missed them is to do so deliberately or to be blind as a bat. I don't care about too much...but PLEASE clean after the last visitors. Other than that staff was friendly and the room was ok. 0 access to the beach which was not advertised on Expedia (which was where I booked). If your looking for a cheap spot to stay NEAR the beach then maybe this will work Look elsewhere if you can afford a little more. Safe travels!!

6504,Palm Suites,Atlantic Beach,2016-09-15T00:00:00Z,34.701386,-76.74691,4.0,Upon entering the property you could tell that it was an old building but it seemed to be very clean and comfortable. I hesitate to make a commit about the room because as we found out each room (condo) is individually owed and decorated. I can say that the staff was very professional and promptly took care of any concerns that we had.
6505,Palm Suites,Atlantic Beach,2016-07-29T00:00:00Z,34.701386,-76.74691,5.0,When we checked in we were mistakenly sent to a room that hadn't been cleaned yet. Immediately the staff switched us to an upgraded room and made sure we were happy with everything. They were truly upset they had sent us to the uncleaned room and did everything and more to make it right. Good customer service will keep us coming back! The room was beautiful and comfortable!

I had an excellent eggplant dish at Ciatti's Ristorante, also the mussels were fabulous. This was probably our best meal. These were all a few miles down Division Street. Don't forget the Green Mill restaurant next door. You can have room service, which I liked. We ate there three times. We have been here for eight days now and I've probably gained that many pounds."

6599,Best Western Plus Kelly Inn,Saint Cloud,2016-02-22T00:00:00Z,45.56067,-94.15608,4.0,I stayed on Monday night then again on Wednesday night. On Monday I got a small room in the old part of the motel. Disappointing to pay the same rate for both rooms
6600,Best Western Plus Kelly Inn,Saint Cloud,2015-10-22T00:00:00Z,45.56067,-94.15608,4.0,Nice hotel. Excellent restaurant. Very small bathroom
6601,Best Western Plus Kelly Inn,Saint Cloud,2015-08-31T00:00:00Z,45.56067,-94.15608,3.0,"The bathtub had a couple of long dark hairs on it. The rooms are small, corners of carpet were dusty, the recliner was very worn. The location is great. The conference room very cold"
6602,Best Western Plus Kelly Inn,Saint Cloud,2015-11-27T00:00:00Z,45.56067,-94.15608,3.0,"Room was too small, ice machine didn't work properly. A bit pricy. But otherwise it was great."
6603,Best Western Plus Kelly Inn,Saint Cloud,2015-10-29T00:00:00Z,45.56067,-94.15608,4.0,Entirely competent: much closer than any other hotel to StCloud convention center.
6604,Best Western Plus Kelly Inn,Saint Cloud,2015-10-26T00:00:00Z,45.56067,-94.15608,5.0,"It was a welcomed retreat after a long work week, I didn't want to leave!"

6606,Best Western Plus Kelly Inn,Saint Cloud,2016-02-19T00:00:00Z,45.56067,-94.15608,3.0,Room was 2 level suite but it was small. The bathroom was really small it felt cramped. It sounded a lot better on page then what it actually was
6607,Best Western Plus Kelly Inn,Saint Cloud,2016-06-10T00:00:00Z,45.56067,-94.15608,2.0,Like the location but hotels.com said free breakfast and there was no breakfast!! Quite expensive for a Inn and no breakfast!
6608,Best Western Plus Kelly Inn,Saint Cloud,2015-12-20T00:00:00Z,45.56067,-94.15608,4.0,so cold my car would not start at 500 in the morning. the girl at the front desk used her own car to jumpstart my car. how sweet was that
6609,Best Western Plus Kelly Inn,Saint Cloud,2015-08-27T00:00:00Z,45.56067,-94.15608,1.0,there were ants in the bed of my co-worker that i booked this trip with and she needed to be moved to a different room.
6610,Best Western Plus Kelly Inn,Saint Cloud,2015-08-05T00:00:00Z,45.56067,-94.15608,5.0,Was in business overnight in St. Cloud for the 1st time. Chose the Kelly Inn based on location and cost. I was pleasantly surprised that the Kelly Inn is as nice as it is. The staff was cordial on check in the Green Mill restaurant is attached and we stopped for drinks and a late dinner. They have a full menu in addition to pizza. The Room was modern and up to date. We were on the 3rd floor and it was very quiet. I'll be staying there again on our next trip to ST. Cloud.
6611,Best Western Plus Kelly Inn,Saint Cloud,2015-07-18T00:00:00Z,45.56067,-94.15608,5.0,Staff was very friendly and accomadating. Nice view on river side. Quiet. Would stay again if in the area.
6612,Best Western Plus Kelly Inn,Saint Cloud,2015-08-16T00:00:00Z,45.56067,-94.15608,3.0,"I was only here overnight and left early in the morning. It happened to be very warm and humid outside, so the air conditioner had to run. It was loud and did nothing to dehumidify the room, so everything (bed, carpet) felt a little damp. Probably better in better weather."
6613,Best Western Plus Kelly Inn,Saint Cloud,2015-06-18T00:00:00Z,45.56067,-94.15608,5.0,The hotel was perfect for our girlfriend get-away.
6614,Best Western Plus Kelly Inn,Saint Cloud,2015-10-17T00:00:00Z,45.56067,-94.15608,4.0,"Hotel grounds were very clean and well decorated. The woman that checked us in was very friendly! My only complaint was room cleanliness, our sheets had multiple stains, and excessive hair in the bathroom. Otherwise, nice place!"
6615,Best Western Plus Kelly Inn,Saint Cloud,2015-07-23T00:00:00Z,45.56067,-94.15608,5.0,We recently stayed for 3 nights and were very happy with the hotel. The room was comfortable and very quiet. Having a microwave and refrigerator in the room was a welcome (and well used) benefit. Front desk staff were helpful and courteous. Housekeeping staff were also friendly. The Library/Business Center was user friendly and comfortable. The only thing that would've made the stay better would be having room service run later at night.
6616,Best Western Plus Kelly Inn,Saint Cloud,2016-01-01T00:00:00Z,45.56067,-94.15608,4.0,"We went there for a wedding reception. The room is tiny when you get a single bed, but it was big enough for two people. The hotel is a little outdated where the rooms are. The lobby is beautiful."
6617,Best Western Plus Kelly Inn,Saint Cloud,2015-08-04T00:00:00Z,45.56067,-94.15608,3.0,The room was OK getting to it was another matter. We could use the elevator to the 2nd floor only and then had to walk up 2 flights of stairs to the third floor where our room was located. We were not aware of this when we checked in which was a little disconcerting as one in our party had trouble using stairs besides getting the luggage up there also. At the time we arrived it was too late to find a different hotel. We should have been notified of this situation at the time of booking.
6618,Best Western Plus Kelly Inn,Saint Cloud,2015-07-22T00:00:00Z,45.56067,-94.15608,4.0,Stayed one night to visit St. Cloud university. Nice and close to the campus as well as the downtown area. The restaurant/bar attached was great for a beer or two. Nice selection of drafts and bottles. We had no issues with our room or stay.
6619,Best Western Plus Kelly Inn,Saint Cloud,2015-09-10T00:00:00Z,45.56067,-94.15608,1.0,"I booked the room using Expedia, so the room was paid in full before I checked in. After my three hour stay, I departed. I was surprised when I checked the billing against my account on Monday and found a pending 150 charge and another pending charge of roughly 42. I called the hotel. they told me the smaller charge was a mistake by the hotel staff. the 150 charge was a fee as they claimed I smoked in the room. I explained that I do not smoke and whoever said that I had smoked in the room was in error and these charges were bogus and fraudulent. The hotel promised they would get back to me the same day. That was yesterday and I still haven't received the call.I would not recommend anyone stay there and also be sure to check your bank statements."
6620,Best Western Plus Kelly Inn,Saint Cloud,2015-11-07T00:00:00Z,45.56067,-94.15608,5.0,Very pleased with the room and hotel.
6621,Best Western Plus Kelly Inn,Saint Cloud,2016-08-06T00:00:00Z,45.56067,-94.15608,3.0,"It was ok, hotel is alittle run down."
6622,Best Western Plus Kelly Inn,Saint Cloud,2015-08-28T00:00:00Z,45.56067,-94.15608,2.0,Two. Isn't stay and room not cleaned
6623,Best Western Plus Kelly Inn,Saint Cloud,2016-09-04T00:00:00Z,45.56067,-94.15608,5.0,"We had a great view of the Mississippi River, stores and restaurants were all within short walking/driving distance."
6624,Best Western Plus Kelly Inn,Saint Cloud,2015-05-03T00:00:00Z,45.56067,-94.15608,5.0,"After being in several motels/hotels around the area, this one was the best so far."
6625,Best Western Plus Kelly Inn,Saint Cloud,2015-08-01T00:00:00Z,45.56067,-94.15608,5.0,The first night we stayed in room 319 which was small and crowded. We went to N. D. for one day when we came back the receptionist upgraded our room to the top floor viewing the river. This was a nice big room with a great view. Thank you so much.
6626,Best Western Plus Kelly Inn,Saint Cloud,2016-09-15T00:00:00Z,45.56067,-94.15608,2.0,Internet down! Washing machine not working. I left a party early to do wash. They could at least have 2 washers and dryers. I am not sure if the place is a hotel or convention center. Too busy and noisy. They did not tell us we get 10 off at the restaurant until I overheard someone else checking in. Stay at the Courtyard by Marriott - it is in the same area and I would guess much better.
6627,Best Western Plus Kelly Inn,Saint Cloud,2016-07-26T00:00:00Z,45.56067,-94.15608,3.0,"I had reserved a single king size bed for 1 adult. When I checked in, I was given a double with 2 queen beds. I was told I was upgraded. For 1 adult Unnecessary. The hallway next to the conference rooms smelled like a urinal. I found my room to be located next to a parking lot exit which about 50 other guests used for a 2 night parking lot party. I heard the outside door slam no less than 50 times per night. The signal for the free WiFi was so weak in my room, I just shut it off and used 4G. Had my conference been at another hotel, I would have moved to another hotel."
6628,Best Western Plus Kelly Inn,Saint Cloud,2016-09-24T00:00:00Z,45.56067,-94.15608,5.0,Surprised at the size of the King room. Very nice.
6629,Best Western Plus Kelly Inn,Saint Cloud,2016-07-17T00:00:00Z,45.56067,-94.15608,4.0,"The motel was great, the only improvement I would suggest would be to the restaurant service, which was a little slow and the margarita pizza I ordered was just like a light cheese pizza. There should have been fresh basil on it and not spare dry flakes with few tomatoes. The breakfast the next day was great though."
6630,Best Western Plus Kelly Inn,Saint Cloud,2016-08-11T00:00:00Z,45.56067,-94.15608,3.0,Good hotel it smelled damp could use some fresh air updating

6632,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-06-21T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,4.0,"I was alone and wanted to be on the more active side of the building but had the feeling I was put in the back, less active side because I had booked thru .com...just a feeling I got..,"
6633,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-02-26T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,3.0,"Although the heater in the was adjustable, it was too loud it was challenging to hear the television with that noise. Additionally, the walls are paper thin and I could hear conversations from both sides of the room."
6634,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-09-08T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,4.0,"We enjoyed the area near the fire pit to enjoy a drink. Room was comfortable, and it looked like a nice indoor pool even though we didn't get a chance to use it."
6635,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-06-06T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,5.0,"We had one of their jacuzzi rooms, the stay was immaculate for our honeymoon. We entered the room and there were rose petals on the bed and a bottle of champagne in the fridge. The indoor pool was great. The hotel staff was incredibly friendly. The hotel is within easy distance of anything you could want to do, food, beach, mini golf, bay. It was a great experience!"
6636,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-06-03T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,5.0,"Had great stay, the staff was great"
6637,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-07-08T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,5.0,we booked this hotel sight unseen and were very happy with our choice. We were on the cape for a wedding and other members of the party told horror stories of hotels they had booked and walked away from because they were so poor. Bayside staff was extremely friendly and helpful. The hotel was spotless and the free breakfast had anything you could ask for. The indoor and outdoor pool areas were always clean and well kept. Very family oriented. I would definitely stay here again.
6638,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-07-10T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,5.0,"Even though the front of the hotel is on Rte 28, it is quiet and the views from the Adirondack chairs in back of the hotel are beautiful. Excellent stay."
6639,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-05-29T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,3.0,They need to remodel the bathroom....
6640,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-06-24T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,4.0,"Place was clean. Room was comfortable. Housekeeping was hit and miss. Some days they did a great job and others days, not so much. Staff was friendly and the continental breakfast was good. Outdoor pool with the bar is a hit, very relaxing."
6641,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-07-08T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,4.0,It was good overall
6642,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-06-10T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,5.0,It was great for a couple who just wanted a weekend away for a couple of days. The staff was friendly and welcoming and the room was spotless and cool wen when the temp rose outside. It was a beautiful facility.
6643,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-05-26T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,5.0,"i had a great time, got to see the beaches and visited P-town which was great"
6644,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-02-12T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,4.0,"Hotel was nice enough. Not as new as we thought from the pictures. Would have been better if there wasn't a hockey team (12-14 yr olds) running wild through the hotel. Staff did their best to keep things under control, especially at the pool, but they were out numbered. The pool towels were x-large and soft. The retractable clothes line in the shower was great since the kids were in and out of the pool several times during our stay. Very family oriented."
6645,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-06-24T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,5.0,Great service everyone working was friendly and will stay again

Only suggestion would be to have another light in the rear parking lot. It was rather dark out there when I had to get something out of the car at night. Otherwise, great place."
6647,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-07-21T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,5.0,Very romantic

6649,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-06-24T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,3.0,"Good value - much better than chains. Very good location. They forgot to clean the room - but otherwise, no complaints. Has typical free breakfast. No room safe. I would stay again (and hopefully with a room clean!)"
6650,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-08-17T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,5.0,"The actual pictures are just as good in person!! Great place! Staff was very helpful with anything we needed! Outdoor pool has a tiki bar where you can order adult drinks food etc! There's also a beach Vollyball net at the outdoor pool! The pool over looks the bay which is where the asesome man made beach is! The beach has a sandy area with Adirondack chairs to relax! The beach is clean, relaxing, and great tunes! You'll find tables there to eat outside too! Close by is the arcade which is great for adults or kids!! If you don't want to leave the resort you can order any type of food from local restaurants that deliver to your room! Great time!!"
6651,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-07-28T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,4.0,Stayed over for night at cape cod music tent
6652,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-07-15T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,5.0,They was plenty of places to eat and the food was actually good. The bartender at the outside pool was great ( Avril )she told us different places we might wanna go see and just fun to talk to. The bartender inside was hilarious. 2 pools hottub and steam room were good..
6653,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-03-07T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,4.0,Great little gem! I really enjoyed my night there

6656,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-06-04T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,5.0,"Was traveling alone to meet up with some old friends. Made many new ones at the hotel . The staff was very pleasant, friendly and helpful."
6657,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-07-20T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,5.0,"Overall very nice hotel and stay. Location is not perfect, outside the main areas to visit, but still fine. Outside pool fine, sufficient. Whirlpool is a nice plus, but the beach side and campfire very nice. Breakfast had great variety, just not enough seating. Pleasant surprice was the availability of drinks all day."
6658,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-06-26T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,4.0,"Family friendly, courteous staff, clean hotel. Two pools, hot tub, arcade room, and nightly bonfires kept us all busy. Very touristy area, so traffic is tough in the summer, but otherwise a great place to stay."
6659,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-06-14T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,4.0,I enjoyed this hotel quite a bit! The only down side is the main desk. I have charges on my account they cannot explain( they're working on it) they are not knowledgable or helpful or friendly.
6660,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-07-12T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,2.0,"My sister, brother-in-law and I were looking for a nice quiet modest hotel on the Cape. My sister had just gone through a difficult recovery for her illness, so we wanted R R big time. What we got was a hotel with kids running up and down the halls, overflowing the swimming pools, and then crying or talking loudly with their families-- all of which could be heard through the paper-thin walls of the rooms. My brother-in-law didn't get to swim once -- there was no room in the pools once all the kids were in. There is one hour from 10 to 11 pm reserved for adults only. Who wants to swim at 10 at night So, if you're looking for a wild, loud adventure with your kids, go for it! If you want RR, run to another hotel."
6661,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-07-08T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,5.0,Stayed for 3 nites breakfast was free and plenty of choices indoor and outside pool clean and opened till 11 nothing negative to say about our stay
6662,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-07-22T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,2.0,The hotel is outdated and has a strange odor
6663,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-04-22T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,4.0,Very clean kid friendly hotel. We stayed a night over school vacation and they had lots of scheduled activities for the kids.

6665,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-02-19T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,1.0,Pool was very overcrowded. There were clumps of hair and candy wrappers just laying by the side of the pool. The lifeguard said she didn't understand English and she actually walked by these clumps of hair several times over a period of 6 hours. Pool area was dirty and had so many adults in the water holding open cans of liquor that we left the pool and didn't return. Won't be coming back here again.
6666,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-06-03T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,5.0,"Our stay was great, the staff was wonderful! Could use better quality of tv,needed for when it rained. And more parking,left to have dinner and see some night life, came back around 10pm and there was no parking left anywhere, we had to make our own, don't know if it had to do with bar there, but if so then you need more parking for the staying guest,otherwise it was a great place to stay!"
6667,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-09-01T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,4.0,"Great value for a family. Needs more protein at breakfast, less sugary carbs."

Great pools, breakfast, fridge in the room, firepit..great location to the adventures we did..only complaint was we were on the 1st floor and could hear footsteps all night long from the room above us.

6670,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-05-15T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,4.0,"First time at bayside resort and I have to admit my husband And I really enjoyed our stay. The pool, hot tub, and sauna were great for relaxing during the day after their delicious complementary breakfast. The area was nice too, plenty of restaurants near by for dinner. Great resort for a relaxing get away! It was quiet, no complaints in hearing our neighbors in the rooms next door. The rooms were clean, beds and pillow comfy. We stayed in a bay view room and it was very lovely!"
6671,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-06-21T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,3.0,"The room smelled a little like mildew, and the restaurant/bar didn't have a lot of selection or gluten free selections. Pool was great! Views were very nice and the staff was very friendly and courteous."
6672,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-01-29T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,4.0,It was okay. Visited daughter. Coffe maker not working but replaced. Extremely noisey second night. Called room and front desk to complain. Finally quiet at 1:30 am. Breakfast good. Good place to crash
6673,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-06-02T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,5.0,I was only there for one night but I would stay there again
6674,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-09-23T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,5.0,"Employees were great, knowledgeable and assertive. Whatever you need is no problem for them to get for you To make your stay better. We stay there often, and it's one of the better, cleaner and more centralized places to stay. We love it!"
6675,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-08-24T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,5.0,Centrally located to most things in Cape Cod. 2 miles to Hyannis which has outstanding restaurants. Perfect size hotel with all necessary amenities. Beautiful indoor pool. Our favorite was the hotel's sandy beach backyard with gorgeous views day or nite! Large gas fire pit surrounded by adirondack chairs great place to return to and hang out at end of long day. Would definitely stay here again.
6676,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-07-02T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,4.0,We were able to relax by the fire and make s'mores while watching the fireworks.
6677,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-05-31T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,4.0,Excellent resort. The premises is clean and well maintained. Housekeeping does a great job each day cleaning the rooms.
6678,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-08-21T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,3.0,"Two night mid-cape getaway. Check-in was friendly and quick. Room and Hotel was clean, a nice upgrade from the run down motor inns that line the Cape. Newer outdoor pool was first rate, indoor gameroom was great for the kids. Location is convenient to both Hyannis and area beaches. Poor bathroom ventilation and a tub that would not drain marred an otherwise terrific experience. Will stay here again."
6679,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-06-26T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,4.0,Our stay was very nice. We enjoyed the hotel very much.
6680,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-06-28T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,4.0,Nice hotel.Beds great. Rooms could certainly use an update and need the tv's to be in HD. Bad pictures on the tv. Pools were great. Property is very prettyand nicely maintained. . Breakfast ok. But its free so hard to complain. Staff very friendly and helpful.
6681,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-07-11T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,4.0,Close to beaches and high speed ferry to Nantucket. Room had a jacuzzi tub and came with a bottle of champagne.
6682,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-06-15T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,5.0,Very helpful staff. At check-in they gave us all the information necessary to enjoy the area. It included a coupon for several different restaurants. The sheet they gave us was full of information on many local sites. .
6683,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-04-11T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,4.0,"Excellent pool, hot tub, and sauna. The room was adequate for our needs. The staff was friendly and helpful. We had fun in the arcade and using the pool table. The best part of breakfast was make-your-own waffles. We were there in the off-season, and there were still quite a few guests there. There's a great firepit in the back near the water that would probably be really cool in the summer."
6684,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-08-31T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,3.0,Just slept there. We were out during the day sightseeing.
6685,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-08-27T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,2.0,"Only room available was on the top floor, no elevator. Old run down smelled musty. Bad choice would not recommend it ever stay there again."
6686,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-08-02T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,5.0,It was a great stay. This is not for a romantic couples weekend - this is a family friendly hotel with amenities for families. Will definitely be back.
6687,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-10-29T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,4.0,Nice place at a good price. Bed was a little firm for my taste but room was clean and quiet.
6688,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-08-07T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,4.0,"central to all Cape Cod. Easy in and out. reasonably comfortable, for the price."
6689,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-09-07T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,4.0,Always have a great time when we stay here. Close to so many different things. Free coffee all day. Pool is great and hot tub.Always very clean
6690,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-09-28T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,3.0,Reservations over three months ago ask for a room in the back with the view check in received a room in front next to the entrance and staircase was very loud could hear visitors coming and going all day and night. When we checked in front desk clerk rude and did not care.
6691,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-07-13T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,5.0,Bed and pillows need updating otherwise perfect
6692,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-04-15T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,1.0,"This was the noisiest hotel stay I have ever experienced. The staff was unable to reign in the loud and obnoxious guests who rattled up and down the halls signing until midnight each night. In addition, numerous unaccompanied children played in the halls all hours of the night. We slept poorly both nights even after stacking all the spare pillows and bedding against the door to try to muffle the sound. I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anybody, not even my worst enemy."
6693,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-07-24T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,5.0,"Loved the pools and hot tub! Everyone was so nice, happy and helpful!!"
6694,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-08-09T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,4.0,The refrigerator in our room didn't work they replaced it the next day we were only there for two days...make sure to double check your fridge if it's not cold when you arrive make sure to call.
6695,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-06-11T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,4.0,"We drove for over 6 hours (with a 7 month old) and although we arrived earlier than the check in time, Mike at the front desk was super nice and let us check in early and that was a life saver! The room was very nice except the Fridge did not work. We were so tired from the drive and the fact that we could check in and nap that I didnt complain or try to exchange rooms."
6696,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-07-24T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,4.0,"We stayed here for a short summer family vacation. It was in a perfect location, close to Hyannis and Dennis for shopping, eating and fun things to do. The toom was comfortable but it would have been greater with a balcony to escape too and the door to the room needed grease making it hard to sneak out of without waking the entire family.. Breakfast was a nice bonus and I enjoyed relaxing on the outside Adirondack chairs overlooking the water, beautiful!!! The pool and the poolside bar really added to the resort feel. All in all, I would definitely stay there again. We had a great time!!"
6697,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-04-22T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,4.0,"We thought hotel was average. Good complementary breakfast. It's close to Hyannis for nice restaurants and things to do. Indoor pool was full of kids, but we went during April vacation week. We stayed in back on 2nd floor, for the most part it was quiet. Away from main road and pool area."
6698,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-07-19T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,5.0,We had a wonderful stay! Very clean the staff was excellent!
6699,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-02-19T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,4.0,They need to improve their breakfast options.
6700,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-07-08T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,4.0,"Nice place, however...We didn't like the ugly brown leaf border, stucco walls, and brown accents- Makes the room look dark, dated, not pretty like the lobby or outside of hotel. It was clean. I saw the bayside rooms- much better with cream tones and no hideous border. You could update the other rooms by simply removing these fall leaf borders and adding light blue beach-like accents.The downstairs was locked at 11:00:just when we wanted to sit and watch the big television and make tea. The breakfast was a nice plus."
6701,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-08-10T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,5.0,We love this Hotel.
6702,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-10-11T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,5.0,We have stayed at Bayside before and truly enjoy it.
6703,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-10-11T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,5.0,"If you have kids you won't go wrong. It's like visiting your favorite relatives that have all the fun things for kids to do. Pools, game room. Rooms are upscale and priced at mid value hotel rates. My wife and I and the kids couldn't have been happier. What a great place. Close to everything."
6704,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-05-11T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,5.0,"Went for an overnight belated anniversary, and everything was just wonderful. Facilities are beautiful, including the pool/hot tub/sauna. Breakfast was very good, and nice to sit outside with a view of the tidal area. Also got a fantastic price since it was still just before the high season. Loved it, and hope to go back again for another anniversary!"
6705,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-07-25T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,4.0,The staff was very nice. The outdoor pool was refreshing with the view of the bay. At night there was a fire pit in music. The free breakfast had options for everyone.
6706,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-01-08T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,5.0,"Friendly Staff,Beautiful Pool Hot Tub with a Clean Comfortable Room!! Can't ask for much more!"
6707,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-07-31T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,5.0,"We booked 2 rooms last minute, and based on the (reasonable) price, weren't expecting much. I was pleasantly surprised. The rooms were both spotless, and the hotel had very nice amenities, including breakfast, indoor and outdoor pools, pub and a lovely sitting area by the marsh. It is also convenient to all beaches, as well as family friendly activities. I highly recommend, and wouldn't hesitate to stay here again."
6708,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-06-14T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,5.0,"Needed a few days to decompress. Didn't want to sightsee or travel to a beach just to sit and relax. This hotel had the perfect backyard patio complete with an outdoor pool and patio plus a sandy beach area overlooking a salt marsh at Lewis Bay. We enjoyed just hanging out reading, swimming and having our morning coffee on the beach."
6709,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-07-28T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,5.0,Nice place clean friendly inside outside pool small little sitting area that overlooks the bay
6710,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-08-28T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,5.0,"This was a mother/daughter get away. Room was clean, staff was great and helpful. We arrived early and couldn't check in but we were offered to use the pool if we wished. Great hotel for a nice relaxing quiet get away. The view is great over looking the bay. The fire pit at night is great. We will be going back."
6711,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-07-31T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,5.0,"We spent Friday - Monday at the resort. I would highly recommend this place. It is one of the best resorts on the Cape. The pool area is great, the beach is so relaxing with shade trees and/or sun. I particularly liked the caribbeean music with Margaritaville radio playing. Unfortunately, the pool and poolbard close way too early - 6pm. The firepit is great at night. Rooms are good, but the A/C could be a bit stronger. Breakfast was good, but only ate it once. Went oout twice for breakfast instead. Needed a change over waffles and premade muffins. Although, I can definately see it is a great value for families with kids. The housekeeping staff was very friendly. Bartender could be friendlier though. One thing I was not thrilled with is when you order lunch at the pool, it is called down to a local restaurant next door and delivered. salds were VERY soggy fries were cold by the time we got them. As I said, we will definately be back."
6712,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-07-22T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,5.0,"Loved the flavor of the hotel. There were many international tourists, families, couples, girls-weekend groups. The staff was friendly and the place was very clean. The continental breakfast was the best spread I'd ever seen. They even had make your own waffle stations. I really liked that even though it was located on a busy street (Rte. 28), when you were in the pool, your room or at the fire pit out back, you did not hear the traffic. By ten o'clock it was pretty quiet with only a couple doors being banged close. My daughter and I thoroughly enjoyed our get away."
6713,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-07-24T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,4.0,"We had a nice trip, hotel was great, just a lot of local traffic made driving around a pain. But we love cape cod and the beaches. The hotel had a great breakfast and the outdoor bonfire was fun."
6714,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-04-07T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,4.0,THe indoor pool was great ! I thought the beach area from pictures on line was larger than it truly was - but overall a nice stay
6715,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-09-30T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,4.0,Great but a bit noisy.
6716,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-10-30T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,5.0,"The location was perfectly located for what we planned to see. Everyone was so friendly at the hotel and the room was very nice. I loved that there was an extra blanket to put on the bed. It rained at night so there was no fire pit, but we enjoyed sitting outside earlier, we played air hockey and pool in the game room, and the indoor pool was very relaxing. We would definitely come back again."
6717,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-03-19T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,4.0,"The hotel, nearby restaurants and sightseeing area were great. The hotel is well maintained with a nice gas fire pit outside on a sandy area by the marsh. We were hoping for a nice, quiet weekend getaway and unfortunately, that did not happen. This particular weekend, the hotel was booked with families with children. LOTS of them. Apparently hockey playoffs were in the area. The rooms are not sound proof and you can hear children running up and down the hallways late at night and EARLY in the morning. Pool was FULL of kids until 10:00pm and Adults Only was for a lousy hour. It would have been nice if the staff extended the adult time for another hour under the circumstances. We would book this hotel again, but next time we will inquirer before doing so. Unfortunately, it just wasn't the relaxing and peaceful weekend that we were hoping for"
6718,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-07-26T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,4.0,"Hotel looks beautiful on the outside, but the inside could use some work. The furniture and decor are all outdated. The bathroom was updated but the tub never was so it looks filthy. There was also a good amount of dust on top of the drapes. The beds were hard and not very comfortable. Not horrible overall as far as Cape hotels go, but a little updating would go a long way. The outdoor pool and beach were great. I like that the hotel supplied actual beach towels (very convienent). The toiletries provided by the hotel were great. Parking was also easy and location is central to restaurants and beaches."
6719,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-08-17T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,4.0,We really enjoyed our stay. It was only for one night but I can see us planning to stay there longer. It has a great family environment. We enjoyed the arcade although I found the games a little expensive for a small arcade. The outdoor pool was gorgeous and had plenty of seating. The indoor pool was great for a swim after dinner. The room were very clean and the beds were comfortable. We were only about 10 minutes from a really nice beach. I know there were others but the one we choose was really nice and worth the short drive. We plan on staying again.
6720,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-04-29T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,4.0,Very basic hotel with some extra treasures. The indoor pool and arcade was great on the rainy days. The staff was very accommodating as well without any unnecessary rebuttal. Overall enjoyable stay.
6721,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-06-26T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,4.0,"Room clean and comfortable, hotel staff friendly, hotel facilities clean, continental breakfast enough quantity."
6722,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-02-06T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,4.0,All was good - friendly staff - nice clean rooms - folks on the 2nd floor were a little loud - thinking small kids - we were on the 1st floor - funky pub - bring a dollar! Pool was fantastic
6723,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-01-01T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,4.0,Stayed two nights for a girls getaway with my daughter and granddaughters. First time at this hotel and the girls liked it better than where we've stayed the past two years. Will go again next year.
6724,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-08-13T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,5.0,"great location, comfortable stay for families, cozy but nice beach and sitting area outside, clean room. Breakfast was ok and can have coffee/tea/beverage anytime."
6725,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-02-05T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,4.0,"We really liked this hotel for the most part. The one major downfall was noise level in the hallways. When people walking by and talking it was like they were in the room with you. There is absolutely no sound barrier and my kids had trouble falling asleep because of it. They were also woken up a couple of times after 10:00. Other than this, the continental breakfast was good and my kids enjoyed the pool. They also have satellite TV - not cable. We were there during a storm - so the television was out most of the time."
6726,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-08-22T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,4.0,Loved the fire pit and places to eat breakfast outside or inside.
6727,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-02-23T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,3.0,"My husband and I go to the Cape every winter for 2 or 3 nights just to get away. We spend our days at the pool swimming, reading and just relaxing. I booked Bayside because we stayed here 12 years ago and had a large room with a whirlpool bath and I remembered the pool area was very nice. (We usually stay at another hotel but it suddenly closed for the winter.) I booked a deluxe king thinking it would be a decent size but it was very small except for the large bathroom which was very nice. The room was very run down in need of overhaul. The pool area was very nice but they had only 2 loungers which we were lucky to get during our stay. Construction woke us up the first morning and my husband planned on going to the gym which was closed due to the construction. We ended up having a good time but I doubt we'll return in the winter season. I'm sure it's nice in summer with the outdoor pool on the bay."
6728,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-01-25T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,4.0,"The resort was enjoyable and relaxing. The only complaints I really had was the room I stayed in. Some of the sheets on the bed had old stains. There was also small damages on furniture that I have noticed. The room did have a slight musty smell every time I entered the room. Also, I was not a fan of the air-conditioner because it was so loud and you can feel the air blowing on you. I'm the type of person who does not like the feel of air blowing on me. At times, you can hear house keeping talking or your neighbors through the wall. Overall, the resort was cute and nice. The free breakfast every AM was a plus. The indoor poor was smaller than I expected but it was nice. My stay was during the winter so I did not experience the outdoor pool or the fire-pit."
6729,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2015-10-25T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,4.0,"the rooms are a little bit dark. decent size rooms. the hotel is very clean, the staff was friendly. there were children running up and down the hallways being fairly loud. the breakfast was just ok."
6730,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-08-09T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,5.0,We had an Excellent Stay at Bayside Resort Staff and all the employees go beyond what we expected they are a Credit to Bayside Resort. We Thank You and we will be back. Donna Michael Deverix
6731,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-01-01T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,2.0,"something wrong with this survey I was not allowed to choose anything other than 3 stars. I actually feel it is 2. never asked how stay was. Kids upstairs very loud running back and forth. Game room right below me kids screaming very loud early AM till late pm. Pubic hair found in bathroom shower corners not cleaned. breakfast was very good I would give that a 4. hot tub pool area was very nice but pool was not that warm. I asked for a map of the area and they gave me a map of all of Cape Cod, I wanted the immediate area.when I called on the phone to book they kept telling me to go to the website after I said I had no access to the website.I was able to book cheaper later through Expedia. pillows and bedding was comfortable. maids making loud noise early in AM with drawers and vacuuming. I wouldn't give it a 3 star out of 5 I would give it a 3 star out of 10 which in my opinion is not that good"
6732,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-02-14T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,5.0,"Excellent hotel, kid friendly with lots of activities for them during school breaks such as magicians, exotic reptile show, karaoke and breakfast with cartoon characters in costume. The continental breakfast was amazing with a waffle maker and plenty of toppings, cereal, eggs, donuts, muffins, bagles, etc. The archade is nice and not expensive like other hotel arcades (games are all around 50 cents). I've stayed at this hotel many times and they constantly work hard to improve the place. They take all suggestions and recommendations to heart. Of all the hotels I have stayed at on the Cape, this js the best one for its price."
6733,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-02-14T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,5.0,Our stay at the Bayside Resort was nothing short of excellent. From the moment we entered the lobby to register until we left 4 days later we were treated wonderfully. The staff was helpful and courteous and very friendly. They went out of their way to make us feel special. Everything was very clean and the continental breakfast was exceptional! we couldn't have asked for more. This is one of the most relaxing experiences we've had on the Cape. We highly recomend it.

6743,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-09-11T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,4.0,Decent Hotel compared to most in the immediate area. There needs to be away to silence the doors from the loud bang when closing. A minor issue with the room (237) was that the tub did not drain well.
6744,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-07-26T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,4.0,Great hotel. Only thing missing was a full breakfast buffet. Only downfall was that tent only serve continental breakfast in the morning.
6745,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-08-23T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,5.0,"The hotel is well maintained, with many amenities. The staff throughout are friendly and helpful. The Wi-Fi signal was very strong and had decent speeds throughout the property. The indoor pool is very large and the hotel has an indoor hot tub as well as a male and female sauna/showers in the indoor area. The outdoor pool has a tiki bar with food and there is a sanded volleyball area adjacent to the outdoor pool. The breakfast is great for those seeking everything short of eggs (though they do offer hard-boiled eggs). The waffles are the star of breakfast (3 machines - get there before 9 to beat the rush). I definitely would stay hear again. Very family friendly too!"
6746,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-08-29T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,4.0,OK.. The staged photos made it seem very upscale..not a place you would walk around at night. Clean and front desk was helpful
6747,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-07-22T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,5.0,"Me my husband and our 5 year old son stayed for 3nights and it was great! This hotel has an indoor and outdoor pool a firepit that is lit at night an outdoor tiki bar by the pool..free continental breakfast! And close to beaches, shops, attractions, restaurants. We went to Water Wizz the largest water park in that area. Embargo and Fresh Ketch for dinner both were amazing! I Highly recommend this Hotel we will definitely be back!"

6749,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-01-04T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,4.0,"Got a great deal on a jacuzzi suite on New Years weekend. Room was very new and clean, the king size bed was extremely comfy, flatscreen tv, great bathroom, and clean soothing jacuzzi tub. Timing was not the best as it was a family oriented weekend so children were running up and down hallways incessantly from 8am till around 11pm but we brought ear plugs thank god. When your neighbor turns their jacuzzi on it sounds like a freight train and they were using their jacuzzi till 1am which was just ridiculous they were probably sleeping in there yet again thank god for good ear plugs and the plush mattress we still managed to sleep great! The continental breakfast was okay, the belgian waffle makers were pretty good and a decent selection of baked goods and cereal. Overall a great value just learn from me and don't go during the New Years weekend."
6750,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-08-26T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,5.0,"My wife and I stayed here for a weekend to celebrate our anniversary. Check in wasn't until 3pm, but we tried our luck on a Friday and they gave us our keys at 11am! We thanked them mentioning it was a great start to our weekend anniversary getaway, and were delighted the next day to find a bottle of champagne, chocolates, balloons, and pink hearts scattered on our bed. These are two examples of the high standard of service we experienced - the kind that makes it easy to recommend Bayside enthusiastically. Ours was a 2nd floor room facing the bay, and given the cool evenings we shut down the A/C and left the windows open. There was some 7am noise as workers prepared the patio tables for the breakfast crowd, but it was nothing severe. Had the windows been shut, I doubt we would have heard anything. Also, we found the pillows a touch on the firm side, but these are fairly minor issues. The location is really good, and we made several trips into downtown Hyannis, which is a very short drive away. Also, great beaches in Dennis are only about 20mins away. Well reviewed restaurants, and other attractions like mini golf and beaches are very close, if not walking distance. We would happily stay here again!"
6751,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-09-25T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,4.0,"Really nice spot on the salt marshes for family vacations, and the close proximity to area attractions and activities. Friendly, helpful staff will make you feel at ease."
6752,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-08-11T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,5.0,We had a great time!! My only complaint is that the beds were hard.
6753,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-08-11T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,1.0,"I brought my wife and two young children for an Easter weekend getaway. I was not aware that a block of rooms nearby were taken by a group that wanted to get drunk and party all night. We tried to ignore the noise but after midnight, my wife asked the group to keep the noise down. They got louder. After two more tries, we contacted the front desk. The night manager stopped by for about a minute asking the group to quiet down. As soon as he left, the drunken mob was angry at us and started slamming into our door. When my wife opened the door to complain, they started to push her around. As soon as I stepped out of the door to help my wife, I was beaten by this drunken mob as my children in the room were terrified. My eye glasses were punched into my face causing me to bleed profusely. I was beaten and kicked as I lay on the hallway floor. My wife also has bruises all over her body. A couple across the hall called the police, but the damage was already done. When the police arrived, the attackers scattered. Some were in rooms on our floor while others were not even guests of the hotel. There are no cameras, no security and a night manager who would rather not get involved. The management told me that there was nothing that they can do because they have no way of knowing who was at fault. Unbelievable. My face is cut up, my wife is bruised and my children are traumatized. Good place if you want to party all night long. Bad place to bring a family. Bottom line the Bayside Resort Hotel was the worst hotel experience of my life."
6754,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-09-05T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,3.0,"My wife and I were given room no 135 on first floor (with king bed). The room was old and not fresh - there was a mild odor and carpet was very old too. The ironing board had a burnt top and we started developing itching at night. We called the front desk and got the sheets changed and I immediately posted a bad review. Next day, our room was changed to room 200 in the second floor which was much better, newer and cleaner. Could not complain about that room. Second floor must be newly constructed and so better. Plus they have the decks. For the hotel's prompt action, I am giving a 3 star rating."
6755,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2016-08-31T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,3.0,"When we arrived at 11 am we requested an early check in. The receptionist replied we will see what we can do, you might be able to check in at 3 she told us we could have a drink at the outdoor bar and the bar tender would let us know when our room was ready. At the outdoor bar the bartender was very friendly . We sat outside with our new born baby had one drink and proceeded to watch several other groups check in. At around 3:15 the bartender called the front desk to ask about our room which was finally ready...In the four hours we saw at least 7 other people pull in and check in then go in there rooms. It was just odd ours took so long and we were last to check in for the day when we were there at 11. Other than that the location was Good the people were friendly the room was dusty and the mattress was hard."

6758,Bayside Resort Hotel,West Yarmouth,2015-12-29T00:00:00Z,41.655436,-70.256179,4.0,"The hotel room was very nice. While the hotel has a historic feel to it, the room is updated and very comfortable. My travel partner did not like the continental breakfast and said that the restaurant smelled. Otherwise it was a great hotel at a great price. The picture shown is of the mansion and not of the hotel."

We were received well and my wife was treated exceptionally well. She loved it. For me personally, it tuned me into a childhood memories of of youth, maybe cause the trees are so big and the home is majestic and dignified. The other guests were respectful of space. If you believe in places of positive energy, this is one of them.. Planning on staying again."
6773,Simpson House Inn,Santa Barbara,2016-07-14T00:00:00Z,34.428888,-119.707704,4.0,A certain charm and a great location but overloaded decor and a few annoying details like the nonstop easy listening music in the dining/sitting area and limited breakfast time slot (8:30-9:30). Good breakfast and lovely hors d'oeuvres with wine in the late afternoon. Nice but highly overpriced for the comfort/service level.

We spent an absolutely wonderful weekend relaxing and enjoying the beautiful grounds and atmosphere. All the rooms are different -- we stayed in the Katherine McCormick room which was cozy and very comfortable. However, what really sets this place apart is the staff. Personal touches are everywhere and make a huge difference to your stay. Also, the food is amazing! We will certainly be back if given the opportunity.

The grounds, house, breakfast, everything was incredibly lovely. An amazing place to stay and an easy walk to everything in Santa Barbara :)"

Bland vanilla decor with small beds. For the price of the room the number of stars, I've stayed at a lot better places. Plus, the pool was super tiny more than a few guests in the pool made it seem like you were crashing someone else's party. Looks like remodeling was underway, but I'd wait until it's complete to go back. Glad I only stayed 2 nights of the 5 I was in town."

We really enjoyed the heated out door infinity edge pool even in February and the room was gorgeous, spacious, and comfortable. Just a case truly getting what you pay for. Worth every penny.

Very upscale and less than ten minutes to the vast dining options in Colorado Springs. Dining at the Garden of the Gods resort is fabulous, too.

The location is convenient and the views spectacular. The main part of the resort, including the restaurant and lounge are lovely. The service was outstanding both at the desk and in the restaurant and the food we ate there was very good. I had two issues, though, which impact this review. The first is that our room was extremely funky. The bathroom didn't appear to have been updated in 20+ years and was covered in mildew. The chrome fixtures were corroded. In the bedroom area, the popcorn ceiling had black streaks from the air vent. The beds' headboards were loosely attached to the beds and would bang against the wall whenever anyone rolled over.The room had nice amenities like a coffee maker and mini refrigerator and the towels were good. As we checked out we were asked about our stay and we were honest about the issues with the room. The person who checked us out mentioned that by this time next year the patio rooms where we stayed will be demolished and a wellness center will go in. My question is that if they know these rooms are bad, why are they still booking people into them"

I initially began the planning process with one wonderfully professional catering manager. She was fired from this venue and I was never informed of this. The successive catering manager was NOT responsive, did not return my calls in a timely manner, and was extremely arrogant. We had problems with our room reservations, late check out communication and a not much was done to accommodate the challenges that we experienced. We spent more than $31,000.00 and were very displeased with The Garden of the Gods Club. We even endured disrespectful comments from club members concerning wedding party members. Their claim to fame is the beautiful background setting...The Garden of the Gods...I was extremely disappointed with their service."

The hotel staff were very friendly during check in. They upgraded our room to accommodate myself and my two children. I was a little disappointed that the rec center with the pool and splash pad were so far from the room. It was about a 5 minute drive into a residential neighborhood. It seems as if the hotel shares the rec center with the neighborhood next to the hotel. However, it was a very nice pool area and there weren't very many people. The pool furniture was very nice and there was a snack bar. Overall our stay was amazing!"

First off, the view from our room was incredible, looking straight out onto Garden of the Gods and Pikes Peak. Was also maybe the nicest room I've ever stayed in. The balcony with the aforementioned view, tall ceilings make the room feel very big, fireplace, pull-out couch, and the biggest bathroom I've seen in a hotel with two separate sinks and a walk-in closet. Granted, we don't stay at luxury hotels so I'm comparing this to your average affordable hotel. Service at breakfast was excellent, although the mostly older and wealthier clientele there made us feel a bit out-of-place with our 4-year-old."

The king size bed was the most comfortable bed I have ever slept on. The laminated floors were shiny and well kept. I usually have problems with hotel rooms because of the carpeting. The only carpeting was around the bed so you didnt have to put your feet on cold floors when you first get up.

I had contacted Constanze 4 months out and told her what we were looking for. She immediately made me feel comfortable with choosing the club to accomodate our special day. It was very overwhelming trying to plan things out of state but Constanze made it a stress-free process. She referred and put me in contact with all of the other vendors we needed and I was pleased with every one we picked. I am a wedding florist in Florida so I was wanting to provide my own decor. She allowed me to ship my linens, vases and flowers and kept them save until the night before the wedding. I arrived the night before to find my room upgraded to a suite that over looked the snowy mountians. The morning of the wedding she took care of everything from setting chair up outside and making sure everything was executed right on time. The food was delicious and everyone was raving about it days afterwards. If I had to do it all over again I wouldnt change a thing. Being in the wedding business I have a lot of experience with vendors and venues and I was very happy with the professionalism.

The front desk was extremely helpful and knowledgeable about the areas attractions. Jessica gave us extra pillows and towels for our baby and kept the room spotless, she even turned the towels into animals!!. And Diane went out of her way to get us a comfy blanket for our baby when the temps dropped outside. Diane saw that i was a bit flustered with the crying baby gave me some very kind parenting tips As for the room...... :-( The microwave did not work properly, or at all at times. We spent the extra money for this room because we needed to refrigerate and warm up formula for the kid. The refrigerator froze up at night and made clunking noises, only to defrost in the morning, leaving a large puddle of water on the hardwood floors. The bed was obviously intended for people who are under 100 lbs, are bean poles, or like self torture, because its hard as a rock. Oh, and i hope you like dogs. You'll be awakened all night long by barking muts because this is the only hotel around that allows pets. Yes, big dogs in a Red Roof Inn.

The room was very clean and we were happy to get 1st floor because we had a pet. We paid 10 extra for pet deposit, which was worth it to stay in such a nice hotel. We parked very close to our room which made unloading a breeze!"

Shower was OK (it had a fold out seat for those that want to sit, and a handheld shower head). The bed, though, felt like a sofabed. The mattress was pretty thin and sloped in the middle on one side. It's right off the highway, and they'll give you a voucher for McDonald's next door for certain items. Good for those who are traveling."

The outside looks run down but I really liked the room we had which was a king. Bed could have been more comfortable.

The dog cried for almost two hours before the owner came back to the room. This happened periodically through my two day stay here , even after mentioning it to the hotel manager the next morning nothing changed.

It was by far the most uncomfortable and lumpy thing I've even had to sleep on. I originally booked 2 queens and received a call the day before to see if we were willing to switch to a King size bed with a comfortable pull out queen bed on the house. She kept emphasizing that the room is slightly larger since we have 2 adults and 1 child. So we agreed. WORST DECISION EVER. The queen pull out was not only lumpy and slanted, but even our 3 year old said she was NOT sleeping on it! Obviously they've never slept on their own pull out because if they did, then it would've been thrown again 10 years ago!"

I asked for a quiet room and explained to the guy I am a chronic complainer of night noise. He chose to put us in a room with a shared door, under a bunch of high schoolers who jumped on the bed until midnight (because they woke me up) and loud lobby noise (which went away around 10:30). I heard every faucet being turned on, every thing the neighbors said and every door close and open. I think the walls between the rooms were an illusion because they certainly didn't block anything except who was in the room next door. It was of course the last room and we were so incredibly road weary. We to stuck with it. And the room smelled like someone had just gone in there and let one rip. Must have seeped through the imaginary walls."

Unfortunately the gentleman who was in the room next to ours tried to get through the adjoining door which was followed by a very unpleasant, strong perfume odor coming from the adjoining door. It took a number of hours before the smell dissipated. The staff assured us that it was merely a deodorizing spray that they had used in the adjoining room. Additionally, at 5 o'clock in the morning, someone in a nearby room had set the alarm clock but failed to turn it off and so for a half an hour we heard nothing but very loud buzzing which unfortunately, woke us up.

Staff was great, the room was clean, hotel shows wear for age. There were some security issues this time as there were persons sleeping in the restaurant 2 mornings that had to be escorted out. We found the hallways to have debris that should have been cleaned up with housekeeping and was not. Few cars were double parked behind guests because they were using the beach access and nothing was done until end of day. There were no cameras and we saw people lingering in halls. We heard it was Beach week which sometimes has issues. Will not stay here again."

The only disappointment we had was with the Breakfast Buffet itself. We were late getting there the first morning and was told they weren't going to put out anymore food. But then we saw them put out more food for the employees to have breakfast. The second morning, there were no hasbrowns, bacon , or link sausage put on the buffet. We have stayed at this very hotel quite a few times and the buffet was always wonderful. I don't know if they have changed kitchen management but I was not happy with the changes or the kitchen managers attitude at all. I found it offensive. Since the breakfast buffet was the deciding factor in picking this hotel on this trip, I may have to rethink where we stay the next time."

We were on the ground floor which is next to to Virginia Beaches Boardwalk instead of a higher floor. In addition it was were the room cleaning people set up in the mornings so carts voices were outside our door first thing in the morning. When we ask to have us moved to a higher floor they said we couldn't move because that is where YOUR organization put us. The hotel was not full when we were there.

However, we were not impressed with the condition of the hotel in general. It's a bit outdated and could use some remodeling work. Room was fairly clean whe we arrived other than forgetting to pick up the cup of cig buts left on the balcony. Room service was also less to be desired.

The room was well appointed and comfortable. The heater was a bit noisy but not bad enough to keep us up. The location to shops and restaurants is perfect and I am sure that this property is a blast during the summer.

Less crowded, good restaurants, quieter, view is terrific! Linda and breakfast staff are so polite, friendly and efficient. Front desk staff just OK, elevator extremely slow, AC/heat much to loud (like the jets flying over until 10 pm)"

All the staff was friendly and professional. Breakfast variety was good, and good quality. Indoor pool was small, but good for a late evening swim with the kids. Only issue we had was with the heat/AC unit in the room. Unit was a little loud for the light sleepers and thermostat took a couple hours of trial and error to get the room comfortable."

Staff were very friendly especially Linda who worked the breakfast shift. Hotel restaurant was delicious and service was exceptional. The pool and hot tub area was clean and always had plenty of towels. My only critique would be that more options of breakfast meat should be available daily. One day was turkey sausage next day was pork sausage. I think both should be served daily. My family and I would stay at this hotel again.

Well this was the last time we will stay here. They gave us a tiny room with no shower which I specifically needed accommodations for my son and was denyed because they claimed the hotel was completely booked all week (we booked in April). The on duty manager claimed she would keep us on a list even if no room became available, there was never an attempt to reach out and apologize or try to accommodate us in anyway. Her response was we can move you to a ground room at a higher rate... Really We didn't screw up you did. Our room was always cleaned after 3pm accept for one day where the house cleaner was amazing!

8060,Hampton Inn Virginia Beach Oceanfront North,Virginia Beach,2016-08-22T00:00:00Z,36.859787,-75.978035,4.0,It was overall ok. The pros: The location was perfect right on the beach next to all the entertainment and restaurants. Free breakfast with a descent selection. . The cons: The only pool this hotel had was indoor! It did have a hot tub both pool and hot tub below average. The pool area only had 5 lounge chairs. Very small. We were torn between this and the Hilton next door which is a notch up due to the Hampton inn having free breakfast and the Hilton having a nicer pool area. We figured that we would save more with the free breakfast and went with the Hampton in. But after being there I would do the Hilton because of pool. It gives you more of a vacation feel. We figured we had the beach so the pool was not a factor. But we went with kids and the beach can be exhausting! Also the elevator and hallways were so hot no AC in those areas.

We had a huge balcony with great views. My children loved watching the wild Dolphins swim from our room. I love that this hotel is close to the center of the boardwalk so you have many options to dine and shop. Free breakfast was amazing!.Even with many people gathering at breakfast, there were many options and the staff were really friendly and kept everything clean and well stocked.

So no room and no money - but Expedia did offer my a $50 credit.  So I was stranded in San Antonio at 1 in the morning with a credit - soooooo helpful.  I asked to talk to a supervisor - was told that there was a 45 minute wait.  Hummm I guess the long wait is because none of your customers are happy.

Would have left immediately, but everywhere else booked for this event and left us stuck !..Dirty filthy ,roaches all over the place. Now I don't expect much from a cheap hotel and it is CHEAP but it is by far the worst I have ever seen and im not a 5 star hotel ,complaining wimp. But I had to write my very first hotel review!!.All 5 of the rooms we went through/viewed in 3 nights smelled BAD, the floors were so dirty and gross I never took my shoes off. The bathrooms were full of mold and filth the tubs look like someone tried to paint them 10 yrs ago and you didn't want to be be barefoot in there believe me.One shower had the on/off valve at the shower head Nicotine stained ceilings/walls with holes in them. Terrrible beds with bed bugs! springs popping out ,comforters with all sort of unknown stains.The last room had the stove removed,leaving the natural gas pipe/valve exposed with no plug on the line allowing anyone to turn it on.That is a very serious Hazard. The kind that LEVELS buildings killing everyone.When I told the desk she said oh thought they plugged those up..Im pretty sure these are rented as apartments during off peak times cheaper.The kind of damage substained to these rooms doesn't come from travelers with their families, there was grease so thick on the range hood and sides of the stoves you could scrape it off.The doors had all been kicked in and broke the trim making the doors barely able to latch"

Then we get to the room and it seemed everything was okay, but on the 2nd day we were there, one of the legs broke on the bed around 4pm while I was taking a nap. I went to the front desk to inform them about this and asked if they could have maintenance come over to fix it while we would be out till 10 or 11pm. When we returned the bed was still broke. I went to the front desk and asked if they would comp the price of the room for the night. He proceeded to get upset with me and told me to check out and then he would refund the price. This was all on a very busy weekend in San Antonio, due to high school graduations and there were no rooms available around the area. Therefore we had to end up sleeping on the pull out sofa. Very uncomfortable for someone who has had 6 back surgeries. Stay away from this place, would not recommend it to my worst enemy.

There was hair in the bath tube and grime around the tube, toilet and sink. The kitchen was also filthy. There were no hangers in the closet. I asked the front desk for some, but they never arrived. Although I was staying there for 4 nights, there was one towel and no wash rags. No waste basket in the bathroom. NO BODY EVER CAME TO CLEAN THE ROOM OR MAKE THE BED OR CHANGE THE SHEETS. There was music and noise most of the night. I asked the lady at the desk if she had ever been in one of the rooms to see how dirty they are. She said No. I asked the Security Guard on nights at the desk how often they get broken into, he said ""Not too many"". Yet I see that room 142 had a new door replaced the day after and that there were multiple new doors throughout the complex.I would never stay there or recommend this place to anyone."

Leaks all over the bathroom, there was a puddle from the moment we walked in. To top it all off, they refused to do a refund despite us staying in the room for only 2 hours, and didn't try moving to another room (like I would trust the hotel anymore.) They said the cutoff time for a full refund was 20 minutes. Or at least that's what they told me three days later. It was Saturday and they told me there wouldn't be a manager until Monday morning (I ended up calling Tuesday at noon, no manager showed up on Monday.) Those two hours were spent unpacking the car, debating whether or not we should leave, and above all, taking pictures of the whole mess. I'll be disputing this with my bank. Meanwhile, never book this hotel. Any of you. Whole place should be closed down and sold to somebody who knows how to run a business."

The people in the room above us had a very impressive stereo system - we could hear them blasting music all night long. Kids are running around everywhere and there's shouting at night.

We saw the low rating but we decided that for one night it really couldn't be that bad. Boy, were we wrong!! When we booked the hotel it said it was the last one available, meaning that all their other rooms were taken. For a hotel that claims to be at full capacity and thus possibly doing well financially, the quality of their rooms is disgusting. We walked into the room and it instantly smelled of cigarette. Nowhere on our booking did it say this was a smoking room. The bedroom furniture was all written on with permanent marker by someone named Chula, who was asking for money. The smoke detectors were broken and hanging from the wall. Some of the outlets you could tell had burned out because they were brown from the outside (we didn't use them.) The bathroom door had a hole in it, there was no toilet paper, or complimentary  soaps. The shower did not work!! Only the bottom part of the shower worked so you had to kneel inside the tub to get any water. The chairs had the cushions fall out. When we finally when to sleep we almost thought there was bedbugs because we saw all these black spots, it turned out to be cigarette droppings. Like really?! The management needs to get their act together and improve the quality of their rooms if they want to continue business in the future."

I didn't even use the bathroom because I didn't want to catch any diseases.This place looks nothing like what was advertised on any website.I will not be staying there again no matter how inexpensive the rooms are.Avoid this place as much as possible."

Would have left immediately, but everywhere else  booked for this event  and left us stuck !..Dirty filthy ,roaches all over the place. Now I don't expect much from a cheap hotel and it is CHEAP but it is by far the worst I have ever seen and im not a 5 star hotel ,complaining wimp. But I had to write my very first hotel review!!.All 5 of the rooms we went through/viewed  in 3 nights smelled  BAD, the floors were so dirty and gross I never took my shoes off. The bathrooms were full of mold and filth the tubs look like someone tried to paint them 10 yrs ago and you didn't want to be be barefoot in there believe me.One shower had the on/off valve at the shower  head? Nicotine stained ceilings/walls with holes in them. Terrrible beds with bed bugs!  springs popping out ,comforters with all sort of unknown stains.The last room had the stove removed,leaving the natural gas pipe/valve  exposed with no plug on the line allowing anyone to turn it on.That is a very serious Hazard. The kind that LEVELS buildings killing everyone.When I told the desk she said oh thought they plugged those up..Im pretty sure these are rented as apartments during off peak times cheaper.The kind of damage substained to these rooms doesn't come from travelers with their families, there was grease so thick on the range hood and sides of the stoves you could scrape it off.The doors had all been kicked in and broke the trim making the doors barely able to latch"

This hotel was so gross, roach infested, dark,and quite scary. The hotel clerk knew the hotel was bad and asked me to view the rooms before I decided to stay. I viewed two rooms. And both looked horrific. Needless to say we did not stay at this hotel and I had to search for another one in the middle of the night. And I was not the only customer in there at that time viewing rooms and deciding not to stay. Do not stay at this hotel. It needs to be condemned!!"

Having said that all the rest was downhill from the cleanliness especially in the kitchen.I can only imagine this was once a pretty recommendable establishment that maybe got overwhelmed with the amount of units to upkeep daily and with kitchenettes in the units comes the constant need to repair the appliances. In our case none of the kitchen appliances worked (fridge, stove, etc.)The location is reliant on a car if you want to see the sites in the city but there are plenty places to eat in the area if you don't mind walking."

Couch was dust and dirt so thick on it. There was no toilet seat on the toilet. How the heck does that work. I asked for a queen bed and said I had two dogs I made sure they knew. When I get there check in is at 4:00 they tell me I have to wait 30 minutes. What have they been doing all day check out is 11. They say oh we didn't see you had dogs and move me to a diffrent room. This is where i get the nasty I cleaned room with two single beds and no toilet seat with filth all over it smelled horrible. I left after being in there for less than 30 minutes. I would rather sleep in my car then be in there a minute longer. I can not believe the filth in that hotel.

Bedding and sofa had large yellow stains.  There weren't any lightbulbs in the room which means there wasn't any light.  I had to use the flashlight in my phone to see.  I called the office about the light and they said I would have to wait until the next day in the morning for the maintenance man.  The rooms smell really bad.  There were holes in the walls and carpeting.  Bathroom was dirty.  I do not recommend this hotel to anyone.  Elevator was broken and I had to carry my luggage to the third floor.  Lock on door didn't work.

Let's start at the door the had big gaps at the top and bottom of the door where you could see outside. There was big hole in the wall that was patched and not painted over so it looked really bad because it was so big. Even though this was a non-smoking unit, all furniture had cigarette burns on them. The room had an odd smell to it. The carpet was very dirty with stains everywhere, I didn't even want to step on the floor without shoes on. The wasn't connected to the wall and the shower was very dirty. To make it worse the universal tv remote didn't work either. I would have asked for a refund if it wasn't to late. I wanted to sleep in my truck. There are a lot of health and safety issues located on this property."

Only two of the lights worked, there were no trashcans, there was trash underneath of the bed, the bathroom was disgusting, there was a layer of what I'm hoping was just dust covering the entire ceiling, the door did not shut all of the way and it was just above all a ver displeasing experience. The staff was great, like I said, and gave me no issues when I checked out early/cancelled the rest of my reservation. I would never stay here again or reccommend to a friend. The photos online were WAY better than the actual hotel itself."

They said the cutoff time for a full refund was 20 minutes. Or at least that's what they told me three days later. It was Saturday and they told me there wouldn't be a manager until Monday morning (I ended up calling Tuesday at noon, no manager showed up on Monday.)Those two hours were spent unpacking the car, debating whether or not we should leave, and above all, taking pictures of the whole mess.I'll be disputing this with my bank.

Upon check in the clerk asked if I wanted to inspect my room because she would not be able to change it after approval...1st hint. I checked out the first room...gap in the door frame so large that anyone could easily break in. i asked for another room...got a mini suite. Refrigerator was frosted up so no cold air in the fridge. AC was barely able to cool the room. Room was old and dated. After one night in the room and finding roaches in the kitchen and bedroom I had had enough. I took a shower and I noticed that my feet were leaving dirty footprints in the bathroom floor! I immediately called Expedia and got the room refunded and went somewhere else. AVOID THIS DEAL!

We simply wanted somewhere to rest for the night before we headed back home. When i pulled up I was so disappointed. The outside looked like a hotel you rent by the hour. The inside of the room was terrible. Water did not work properly, there were no towels, there were stains on the couch, chair and floor. It was so bad I didn't even let me two year old sit on the furniture. This was supposed to be a non smoking room however it smelled like smoke. There were also cigarette burns on the wall. The shower didn't work and it looked like bed and the frame needed to be replaced. We didn't bother to stay. After 20 minutes we packed our bags and left. The front desk staff said we were unable to get our money back and gave us the run around about the room being used therefore no refund. I even called the owner and Expedia and they both gave me the run around. This place should be shut down. No one should live here. This hotel should not even be listed on Expedia. Again i was in a rush and i didn't read the reviews so it is truly my fault. But a place like this should not be allowed to advertise."

What a pleasant surprise this hotel was! The room was bigger than expected, so comfortable, very clean and well kept, and we loved the little kitchenette area. We weren't expecting nearly what we received for the price. If we ever make our way back to this area again (which judging by our experience at the college, we definitely hope to)this will absolutely be our first choice in hotel accommodations."

Continental breakfast provided many options, hotel staff were very friendly, and the beds were very comfortable. The only thing I would change is the sofa in the suite which was very worn and not comfortable."
8452,Comfort Suites,Springfield,2015-10-23T00:00:00Z,39.89509,-83.81486,5.0,"Staff was very friendly. Other than individual I spoke to in the phone a week prior to our stay, everyone on staff was very friendly and in sync. We stayed the first night of our honeymoon. Person we spoke to on the phone said they didn't do anything special for honeymoon which was fine. When we got to the hotel, however, the manager checked us in. He said that he ALWAYS does something for honeymooners and apologized for the misinformation. Wonderful hotel! No complaints."

Super spacious, comfortable beds, nice couch to relax on and the little kitchenette was great to have. The bathrooms were a little on the cozy side, but the rest of the rooms were great. Hotel staff was super friendly and the breakfast was wonderful! I would definitely recommend another stay at this location."

8463,Comfort Suites,Springfield,2016-07-07T00:00:00Z,39.89509,-83.81486,5.0,Hotel was nice clean. Breakfast was very good and the attendant very quick to keep things filled up and clean. Could have been a disastrous stay as I left my company I-Pad in the room and checked out. About 10 minutes later I got a call from the manager that housecleaning had turned it in and it would be available for me to pick up. Luckily we had stopped at the antique malls not far away. I returned right away and was reunited with the I-Pad after showing i.d. I was very grateful and asked if I could leave a reward for the honest housekeeper which I was told yes. There's something to be said about integrity and how it reflects on the whole operation.

8472,Comfort Suites,Springfield,2015-07-14T00:00:00Z,39.89509,-83.81486,2.0,"Hotel itself was acceptable. For a highway interchange hotel it seemed to be on par with what one would reasonably expect. Unfortunately my car window was smashed during the night property was stolen. Mgmt alerted me to the break in and was polite and accommodating when asked for assistance. However I have to say that management seemed almost disturbingly unconcerned. It took 3 attempts to get the police dept to respond. The 1st officer was sympathetic but explained there was nothing they could do. The 2nd officer was very short tempered and said that they simply did not have time to deal with minor crimes. The 3rd officer, who actually did come to the hotel, told me that I should not stay anywhere at that particular interchange due to the very high crime rate and that I should leave the area as soon as possible. I could not drive the car with my young son because of the amount of glass everywhere in the car. Because of a string of mishaps the repair company was not able to finish the repair until nearly 8:00pm. This made for a long night of driving home after a very stressful day. Hotel staff was adamant that there was not room for me to stay an additional night and did not allow me to stay in our room past 3:00pm. We wound up camping out in the lobby. Hotel mgmt seemed to indicate that a room might be available. To be perfectly honest I could not stay another night at the hotel and expect to get any sleep. It was a scary situation that could have been much worse."
8473,Comfort Suites,Springfield,2016-06-02T00:00:00Z,39.89509,-83.81486,3.0,Hotel is too close to the interstate and resulted in a somewhat noisy room.

8476,Comfort Suites,Springfield,2015-09-17T00:00:00Z,39.89509,-83.81486,3.0,"Most personnel were very friendly and helpful. One front desk employee failed to resolve a problem I was having with the lobby computer, and offered no alternate solution. Paper products (TP, facial tissue) are of inferior quality. Breakfast was mediocre, but there are many restaurants in the area to find a decent breakfast. Although this is a non smoking hotel, cigar smoke was very evident one evening on the 2nd floor."

8483,Comfort Suites,Springfield,2016-05-10T00:00:00Z,39.89509,-83.81486,3.0,"This hotel was on the more expensive side given the area. When I first walked in, it was very well decorated and I was excited. However, the staff completely ruined that by failing to greet me. I told her I had a reservation (after she failed to say anything). She rudely stated she needed my name. The room was ok. I bought one with the hot tub (I know it was probably gross but I didn't care). The signage with instructions for the hot tub was incorrect, which made turning on the jets confusing. Other small issues included a stain on the carpet, cobwebs near the window, knots of hair stuck to the wash cloth, and an air conditioner that came on and off every two minutes. The one positive was the bed seemed clean and comfortable. Not the worst place I've stayed, but not the best either."
8484,Comfort Suites,Springfield,2016-02-26T00:00:00Z,39.89509,-83.81486,5.0,"I was EXTREMELY pleased with this hotel. Given the price, my expectations were low so I was pleasantly surprised when we arrived. Room was very clean, nicely appointed and the staff was friendly. The beds were comfortable and quiet. There as a college track team at the hotel as well as quite a few high school aged volleyball teams. The ooms were situated so that it was not a problem and we didn't hear a sound. The beds were outstanding and I slept great (which is rare for me at hotels). The only downside was the lack of restaurants and the neighborhood. Because its right off the highway the management doesn't have a lot of control over the kind of characters in the area. Overall, I would stay here again without hesitation and the price makes it an unbelievable deal."

As we were leaving, my fianc got an alert on his card that the hotel had just charged us a 50 fee. Upon checkout, we were informed that we were charged for smoking! We never smoked in the room, and no one had even been in our room to check, yet they just knew it was us. After we insisted our room be checked, it was determined that the odor was coming from a different room, and we were promised that fee would be reversed. IT STILL HASN'T BEEN!

Watered down waffle mix Apple juice and orange juice just to save money (yea I'm hip to their game). Then as you walk into the pool room we almost passed out from how much chlorine was in the water and we had to open the door to outside (surprised they could afford the chlorine). As we began to swim, the bottom of the pool was so broken that it cut all of our feet up. So then we proceed to get out and the manager is waiting on all of my kids saying they need to be completely dry before they leave the pool room. Having the lady lol everywhere we walked . EVERY hotel has water foot prints at some point and time from guests going back to their room from their swim time. He's asking me how many people we had and the number was correct ( heaven forbid we have one extra person that would cost him money). He was so unprofessional, and as he didn't think we were going to notice the bleach stains on the couch they tryed to clean and the black couch arms(yuck). I could even breathe from my OCD kicking in overdrive. Price list for each individual item unaccounted for posted everywhere and it is already known to leave all hotel items behind or you could be subject to fees but wow. I checked out early and got my money back. This particular hotel is a disaster and used to be a good one before this new owner...all about the money, not the wellbeing of the customer."

It was spacious and being on the 4th floor, it was quiet. The room was very clean. The bathroom was a bit on the small size though and needs a little updating and maintenance. The swimming pool appears nice, but small. The pool room was too cool for us to take a dip. We would have frozen once we got out. The breakfast was the standard hot fare - instant eggs, sausage, biscuits, waffles, apples, bananas, oranges, yogurt, cereal, juice, and coffee. Our 3rd morning there, i noticed numerous ants on the table where the coffee was. i told the breakfast lady, who cleaned it up."

So, we got a good rate through Expedia, felt good about that. Checking in, well that's where the disappointments started. The lady at the desk was not friendly at all, sloppy, no smile, etc. We got the room keys and the room was clean, so okay, going better. The HVAC controls didn't seem to work as we thought they should - eventually it seemed like it was okay - cooled the room down nicely. The bathroom could have been really nice, but the paint on the wall was cracked and starting to chip. The edge of the tub had one chip repaired and another not yet repaired. On to breakfast in the morning. Eggs were overcooked and cold, but otherwise it was generally okay - nothing to write home about. We used the side entrance several times and the scanner seemed like it was broken like the enclosure was missing, which made it awkward to slide the access card for entry. It is in a good location, close to the freeway and several fast food places."

I have stayed at other hotels at this exchange but have decided that I like Comfort Suites the best. The staff is friendly and really seem to care about us guests. I feel safe there while traveling alone, which I didn't feel at some of the other hotels. The amenities are solide with coffee, breakfast, A/C, hairdryer, fridge, microwave, etc. my only two complaints are the pillows are too full and fluffy and the pool doesn't open until 10 am so I cannot get my morning water aerobics in. Otherwise, the rooms are spacious and affordable. Great value here."

The room was clean and well-appointed and all rooms have balconies overlooking the ocean with the hallway providing panoramic windows to look out to the west. The only real distraction was that the construction type of the building and the heaviness of the doors and spring action needed to shut the doors meant that you heard every door on the floor close very clearly and you could hear noises from the room next door. It doesn't seem like much except that everything else is quite silent. It is why I only give the comfort level a 3 out of 5 as it is hard to get comfortable when you hear doors slamming shut all of the time."

When we first walked into our room there was a weird mildew type smell in the room and the towels in the bathroom smelled the same way. We had to open the sliding door to let some fresh air into the room. The pictures for this hotel look much nicer than the actual rooms, our bathroom had very little space and the countertop near the sink had a large crack. We had to kill a couple of bugs during our two night stay and the overpriced Coke machine outside of the room had expired drinks. The last morning of our trip the toilet stopped flushing and that was kind of the last straw with this hotel, we were glad to be checking out and we would not recommend staying here. We did make management at the front desk aware of our experience and they gave us a free Coke and a membership to their rewards program with around 10,000 points to make up for the issues... the points do not even come close to giving us any rewards through their program. Disappointing stay overall."

Very elegant, comfortable, and spacious. The hotel staff were pleasant and helpful. The room had a make-shift kitchenette without glassware or silverware, but behold...a Keurig!!

Had to keep running the exhaust fan 24hrs to get rid of smell, good thing was, atleast it worked. For the mattresses, one queen mattress was good enough to hold 2 adults without sagging. Other mattress was terrible seems like the coil was damaged. As soon as I sat on the mattress it depressed 3-4 inches. We avoided to use that mattress to avert back pain. We let our 8 yr old sleep in the middle of the mattress to avoid any discomfort. Overall for the price of the room I was expecting atleast basic amenities to be in good condition."

The hotel was better than expected, super stylish decor and furnishings, cool vibe, complimentary breakfast. Location location location. The only thing i didn't like about the hotel is that they use double beds instead of queen for their double bed rooms, pretty small for two people.

They ended up giving us a room for that night. I am upset because I didn't receive the rewards toward the free night stay because the hotel marked us as canceled. We did not cancel. They couldn't find the reservation on their end. I called them and hotels.com and they said they will call me back to solve the problem. One week later, and no one called. Upset at hotels.com and the hotel right now... not sure if I trust to book through this website again."

We had a family of 7 in two rooms, both rooms were handicap versions, no tubs for kids, and located at extreme opposite ends of the hotel. They claimed it was due to being extremely full, despite booking months in advance and giving them two warnings of our arrival 24 hrs prior and morning of. Handicap rooms were totally inappropriate with small children. They made zero effort to put us close together. Do not recommend for families. Dining room is too formal, and they do not allow children in the lounge. Room service wasn't perfect. Asked for wine with 4 glasses and a bucket of ice. They brought 3 glasses and no ice. They charged a late evening service charge for room service before 8 pm. Won't return I'm afraid."

We go there for the pool and to escape the San Francisco fog. The pool is poorly staffed. Towels are scarce and their isn't a bartender. There is one waiter for the whole pool and he doesn't take orders you have to go make a phone call to order room service and then over an hour later your food/drinks are delivered. Bad business and lost revenue.

I had a knee operation so having to change elevators to get from the street to our room was not easy and painful.

The rooms are clean, the bed comfortable, but the tub was tiny (too small to take a bath) and dilapidated. It stood out. The problem with the hotel is the noise coming from the street. At night a guy sets up a music box on the street and attempts to sing along. The music was horrible and the sound carried into the room as if he was sitting next to me. Despite my complaining, it went on till well after 11 p.m. I was not able to sleep, read or think due to the sound. I know it is not exactly the hotel's fault, but I would of appreciated being given some information about how loud the room was going to be during the evening. I was uncomfortable in my room which made my stay not so good."

However, when we arrived this had not been done. The person on duty really was quite cordial and nice to work with on arranging our stay. We were placed on the 3rd floor, but upon trying to settle in, several things did not work and we did not have a bolt lock on the door. The gentleman placed us in a room next door (335) and everything seemed to work. When my husband dropped the broken knob from the refrigerator, he found it under the cabinet, along with some dirty paper plates :( . During remodeling, things are iffy. We had a hard time accepting the facility garbage and mattresses in the back garage, also. The continental breakfast in the morning was wonderful! We think that when the facility completes the renovation project, it will be a lovely place to stay as it has/will have many amenities for those looking for extras in their hotel stay."

Also, maybe a sign asking patrons to help themselves to the pancake machine but to please bring all butters, syrups, jellies etc to be used on pancakes back to table to avoid causing a logjam so others could get to the machine. May be minor point, but would improve the whole breakfast experience commensurate with the hotel quality. Thanks, Glenn Secola"

The female manager (Australian, I believe) was quick to offer to comp us a night which I thought was odd. Fast forward to our last night: the comp was only a credit for a partial night but in turn she drastically increased the rate of our last night making the room 3 times what we booked for. She locked us out of our room and refused to give us access to our belongings until we paid the inflated amount. We were left on a Friday night with the option to pay or leave. We had no choice but to pay but refused to stay the final night due to her hostility. My kids and I quite uncomfortably were forced to slept on my sister's couch."

The parking garage is dark and not easily seen if there's a problem, and the door into hotel says to use room key - but not only do you not need a key, the door doesn't even latch, and it appears a new handle was put in place to override the latch/lock handle. Interior is accessable to anyone and there did appear to be someone in the garage area who didn't seem to have any business there. We could park in front and go in that way, the room was big enough and comfortable, but this security issue isn't worth saving a few when there are reasonable and good hotels nearby."

The curtains in the windows were in disrepair. There were boards in the windows. It looked like it was a live-in hotel. It is located directly next to a Mcdonalds which is to say they shared a parking lot. The television service was 90 oriental and Hispanic television and we had trouble finding a channel that we could understand. Upon walking into the hotel, we did see a sign that they were doing remodeling. However, we considered going to another hotel because of the shape of this one. We did like the bed which was very comfortable and the room itself was dated but clean."

One of bed covers has 2 holes. Staff could have corrected room but to fix room would mean switching to room at back of building.

I found the same kinda water in the fridge. It was an 8 pack with only one full one left in it. I have no idea if it was supplied by the hotel or not. We threw it out. The toilet made a high pitched noise that would only stop it after you flushed it again. The Kleenex tissue had only 1 tissue and was never replaced at all. The morning we left when we stopped by the continental breakfast the same employee that checked me in was there. She acknowledged 1/10 people in the room. I even said good morning to no reply. It was a convenient location for our trip to Becker College for our son. We had a 2 day orientation and would have had a more pleasant stay here if things like this were actually addressed. I know it's hard work and not appreciated by many. But as for someone that works in customer service every day myself I was amazed by the lack of interaction between hotel staff and guests. These things reflect upon upper management. Maybe some team building exercises to make their job not just a job but a fun and good safe place to work as well.

My only negative things I would say are that there was only one chair in our double bed room, but I'm sure if we had asked. the staff would've gotten us another chair! The biggest issue is the layout of the bathroom. I only saw 2 rooms, so I don't know if they are all like this, but the shower/tub is in a narrow little closet-like room with a toilet. The sink and counter is outside that space in an area next to the door of the room is not screened off in any way from the bedroom section. As a disabled person, I frequently take sponge baths at the bathroom sink. In this situation there was absolutely no privacy to do so, which was inconvenient for me. If all you do at the sink is brush your teeth comb your hair, this won't be an issue for you. But I didn't like the thought of people using the toilet, then using the doorknob with unwashed hands to get out to the area to wash their hands. Besides inconvenient, it seemed unhygienic to me. But that aside, this is a lovely, friendly place to stay in Auburn so wonderful to be able to travel with my dog!"

I was looking forward to a night of relaxation but was unable to watch the Stanley Cup Playoff games because channel NBCSN ( NBC Sports Network ) was not available.

Worst thing about this hotel is the staff- I believe her name starts with letter T----. she is unfriendly, rude and does not know dealing with customers. There are no microwaves or refrigerators in the standard rooms and you won't get one even if you request it. So we ate our own food in the kitchen room( to microwave the food) that night. This lady seemed to be VERY UPSET because she had to clean the trash can once again(as we threw our left overs there). She showed her frustration to us. we felt this very disrespectful as she was frustrated JUST because she has to clean that trash can once again! Front desk staff never smiles at you (neither at check in or check out process). Bathrooms are very congested. Bathroom shower has full of rust. I would NOT recommend standard rooms for families as they are very small (Ok if you are a single).. Bottomline- I will not stay at this hotel again."

But my stay there turned out to be better than I expected. The room was small, but not too small for my needs the bathroom was adequate, even if the shower was a little noisy and the bed was spacious and reasonably comfortable.

9090,La Quinta Inn Auburn Worcester,Auburn,2015-09-22T00:00:00Z,42.199763,-71.840633,2.0,"I booked this hotel based on its convenience and the fact that it was pet friendly, but was not up to par with others in the chain nor the quality for the price. The front desk was small, the hotel was recently renovated but it dd not appear to be and smelled smokey. The most disappointing part of my stay was when I realized the comforter on my bed was stained and dirty, what appeared to be an old pet accident stain accompanied by dirty marks. I was in a pet friendly room, however I expected it to be clean. Otherwise, the room was ok, could have been cleaner, floor in the tub felt unsteady and ceiling had questionable spots. Also the tv reception faded in and out and on my second night completely cut out and never returned. Breakfast was free but not worth the time it took to get downstairs. The first morning was ok, as they offered hard boiled eggs and fresh fruit. Morning 2 was only waffles, cold cereal and toast. No healthy options for those of us uninterested in a processed breakfast. The staff was friendly, location and parking was good, and I liked the fact that they don't charge additional fees for pets. They did accidentally place a 200 hold onto my credit card, which I questioned at the front desk upon checkout and was told it was a mistake by another employee. Overall, I had reservations about this hotel based on other reviews I read before booking but figured I would give it a try since it has undergone a recent reno. I won't stay at this location again."

Simply needed a place to sleep that was close to the highway and not overly expensive and this fit the bill. We had minimal interaction with staff other than to check-in which while not overly friendly, wasn't unfriendly either. Room was what we expected - and fine for what we needed. Bed could have been a little more comfortable, and the rooms (which had an adjoining door) are not soundproof - we could hear everything when the guests checked into the adjoining room in the middle of the night. Breakfast is minimal, but again, was as expected. Overall, the hotel was fine for our needs and the price."

Stayed on the first floor and heard some little child running back and forth for about an hour as we were unwinding and trying to go to sleep. Fortunately we discovered the television has a few themed screens which play environmental sounds. We chose the full moon over the ocean and finally let the ocean waves lull us to sleep. The hallway definitely smelled of cigarette smoke, but fortunately the room did not. However, they sprayed with scented spray, despite my request otherwise. The breakfast was not anything we wanted - all breads, cereals, waffles. I have a gluten intolerance. So I grabbed an apple and went elsewhere. The coffee ran out early and wasn't that good - bitter. The hot water for tea wasn't quite hot enough to make true tea. The bed was fairly comfortable - very firm and the pillows were a bit too chunky for my preference. The fan in the bathroom was quite loud. No night lights, but the full moon theme on the television sufficed as a night light."

It would be such a great spot anytime when going to CT, but they just need to clean. The room wasn't bad inside. The flooring throughout all common areas: stairs,dining room rugs, tile floors, and hallways haven't been kept up. I would estimate at least 2-3 weeks without sweeping. The worst was the pool area. Crazy amounts of hair all over the floors. Not just from one day, but at least 2 months worth. It was so gross. Not sure if an entire family manscaped or what. It would be a really great place, if they cleaned and washed Windows. As soon as we pulled in , I told my wife if the landscaping looks like this, we should go somewhere else. I can't under stand how the grass and neglect of landscaping can't be taken care of. It would take a maintenance person 2 hours a week, but I guess the ownership doesn't care.

9177,Dockers Inn,Branson,2016-05-20T00:00:00Z,36.632772,-93.272004,3.0,"For the price, things were pretty good. We would stay again IF they would do something with their water pressure and shower heads. They are the worse I have ever seen. There were several stands in the room that looked like they had not been dusted in months. The breakfast was very good with a nice selection. Check in and staff at front desk were very nice. Overall, it was good until we had to shower."
9178,Dockers Inn,Branson,2016-07-02T00:00:00Z,36.632772,-93.272004,2.0,"The toilet was gross. Bowl had been scrubbed but who knows the last time the bottom and around the toilet had been cleaned. Sheets had stains on them and the bed skirt was ripped badly and looked terrible. All the furniture just looked tossed in there just because it fit and there was a safe in the room but said, do not use so that seems pointless. There was only a TINY bottle of shampoo plus conditioner and it wasn't enough enough to use for just Myself let alone 4 people. You could tell the room never seems to get a good clean. Just the standard bed change and replenish or towels and few condiments.The customer desk answered a personal phone call on her cell when she was signing us in. I would never stay at this hotel again especially at 135 bucks a night!"

9184,Dockers Inn,Branson,2016-08-05T00:00:00Z,36.632772,-93.272004,4.0,"In town for a conference, got to room at 10 pm, traffic on the main hiway is awful at that time. This hotel is on the SW side of town. Air conditioner worked well, sheets were clean, coffee and biscuits and gravy were very hot in the am. We left room at 8am. Older hotel, but ok. No smoking a plus."

9196,Dockers Inn,Branson,2016-07-23T00:00:00Z,36.632772,-93.272004,4.0,Hotel room was a little dated but beds where good and room was clean. Free breakfast was ok but it was same thing for 4 days. Staff was nice and very helpfull. I Would stay here again.
9197,Dockers Inn,Branson,2016-05-19T00:00:00Z,36.632772,-93.272004,3.0,"Room was comfortable, but carpeting needs to be cleaned or replaced. Rest of room was very clean."

9199,Dockers Inn,Branson,2016-06-17T00:00:00Z,36.632772,-93.272004,4.0,The best free hot and cold breakfast I've had so far. It was nice that breakfast time was open till 10am. Was able to sleep in a little bit and still be able to enjoy breakfast before hitting the famous Branson strip. Had some very minor issues but management handled it in a very accommodating manner so no need to make a mad review. All in all I can't wait to go back and will definitely see if Dockers Inn has any vacancies.
9200,Dockers Inn,Branson,2016-08-05T00:00:00Z,36.632772,-93.272004,5.0,"We looked for a cheap hotel (around 50 a night) with a pool and deluxe breakfast for an end of dummer quick getaway. This was a good choice Expedia. Came down later than we planned due to traffic on the hwy. I called Craig at the desk and let him know- and he was so friendly and Waited for us before locking the lobby door. The room was large, CLEAN,and comfortable. Updated with flat screen microwave AND a refrigerator / freezer combo. Perfect! Breakfast was cereal, French toast, biscuits and gravy, sausage or bagels but no eggs. There was plenty of food and space to eat. The pool is outdoors and had plenty of chairs - open 9 to 11 pm. The water was cool on 100' day but the filter needed to be run -water was a little cloudy. The air conditioner blew cold and stayed cold the whole stay even though it was 100 every day. Overall a great stay ! I would recommend It and stay again on our next trip down in the fall! I only gave facilities an average grade because of the pool. The lobby, parking lot, and common areas were clean and trash free."
9201,Dockers Inn,Branson,2016-08-30T00:00:00Z,36.632772,-93.272004,5.0,Wonderful experience. Will stay again

9204,Dockers Inn,Branson,2016-06-02T00:00:00Z,36.632772,-93.272004,1.0,"Absolutely awful... The in-room phones did not work, no wifi access. But thats not the bad unfortunately. All electricity went out at probably 2am. Floors were so gross, I never took my shoes off, air conditioner unit sounded like a wounded animal. Killed two spiders, and a roach. The office was closed, and I just left, to find other accommodations."

9209,Dockers Inn,Branson,2016-06-18T00:00:00Z,36.632772,-93.272004,3.0,"The front desk staff was great and friendly during check-in time and check-out. We stayed at this place years ago and really enjoyed our stay. I am not a smoker and this time the outside walkways and parking lot smelled like a smoke pit. The walkways had numerous bucket ashtrays and the parking lot had cigarette butts scattered around. I do not want to smell nasty cigarette smoke that may cause adverse health problems for me, my wife and toddler. I would suggest having designated smoke areas away from the hotel. I was not impressed with our stay this time round, we only were staying here for one night after our weekly resort stay. The breakfast was good with a variety of foods for all to eat. The breakfast hours were great, 7-10."

We were promised rooms on the first floor so my mother-in-law wouldn't have to climb steps. Instead we were given rooms on the second floor which was at ground level, but breakfast was served on the first floor. When we questioned the reservation all we were told was that we tried to accommodate you but couldn't. This was after we were promised three times that we would get rooms next to each other and on the first floor."
9212,Dockers Inn,Branson,2016-04-22T00:00:00Z,36.632772,-93.272004,4.0,"Dirty towels on the back of the bathroom door, otherwise the room was clean. No remote for television. Lady at check-in was rude when I wanted to pay cash instead of charging to the card that I had used to reserve the room. Breakfast: Terrible coffee. Unless you are an oatmeal person, the only real protein was sausage. No eggs or yogurt. Soggy french toast. Other choices were biscuits, plain gravy, dry cereal (milk), juice, apples, toast, cake donuts, bagels. CARB overload."

They went out of their way to be helpful from calling to confirm what time we would be there (to have the room ready) to answering questions about shows, etc. The room was very spacious and had a great full-size microwave and larger apartment-sized fridge. The beds were VERY comfortable. I usually have a hard time sleeping in hotel beds but not this one (firm, but not too firm)! There were some minor cosmetic issues but overall well-kept and clean. Only complaint I could give: there were no eggs with breakfast (important for those with dietary restrictions)"

Beds are comfy, staff is friendly and breakfast is beyond adequate with a good variety. The room was less clean than it has been in the past and hotel was in a bit rougher shape. But also know this is nearing the end of tourist season so not surprised. Love the fact it is off the main drag enough that it is quiet."

We didn't use the pool, but it looked nice. The hotel is close enough to the strip to walk, but far enough that you don't have all the busy traffic in front. The beds were very comfortable. It is nothing fancy, but to me cleanliness and comfort are on the top of the list. Great price also."

Our 3rd floor room had a refrigerator and coffee maker. No microwave. Bed was comfortable. A/C worked great. Plenty of hot water (caution: very hot water) for the shower. Room did not have a phone, but that was not an issue for us. Breakfast was good included biscuits and gravy, french toast, sausage, cereal, oatmeal, and fruit, very good coffee and juice. Only thing missing that would have made it better would have been scrambled eggs. Staff was very friendly and helpful recommending shows to go see."

There are chairs and a smoking pot next to each door. Not attractive. No elevator. The ice machine on the 2nd floor didn't work. I had to take the stairs to the ground floor to the working ice machine. The free breakfast was pretty good.

The pool is a little small for a hotel of this size and in the shade a good portion of the afternoon. It's a cheap Uber ride to the parks and Target is directly acrossed the street."

The 15 isn't the issue, it's the fact that at check in I was given a card to place in the windshield overnight. Not once did the hotel employee mention a fee for parking."

9303,Anaheim Marriott Suites,Garden Grove,2016-05-30T00:00:00Z,33.78814,-117.916591,3.0,"Unfortunately king bed was hard and uncomfortable, so not a good night's sleep. The pull out bed was really bad. The head of the bed was lower than the foot of the bed and the mattress was almost non-existent. Also, the bed wasn't made and there were no linens, so I had to call for them. The mattress cover had old blood stains so that had to be changed out also. Was very disappointed because the room was clean otherwise and the pool area was nice. But the point of a hotel is to sleep and when the beds suck, it makes the next day miserable."

There is also not enough staff present in the lobby for questions, help, etc. Pool area is nice and large but dirty and constantly out of towels. Pool area needs to be monitored more."

My wife and I had never had the opportunity to stay at a Marriott hotel, or in a suite for that matter. We arrived early, hours before check in, and the staff were great. The bell men held our bags until our room was ready so we didn't have to carry them around. When we got our room, we had the choice of second floor or eleventh floor. Floor 11 here we come. We were amazed when we walked in the room. Very elegant. The pics on the website didn't do any justice. Very nice.... The only problem with the room was the hardness of the bed. We had a king suite, and the mattress was like sleeping on a piece of plywood. Other than that, we enjoyed our stay."

We finally got help from him to our room but the process took about 25 minutes when there was no line or other customers present. Our room was very dirty complete with hair on the bed pillows, sick and bath tub. There was even a Calvin Kline pant sticker stuck on the bedroom door. We stayed two days and informed the staff of the issues, but the sticker was still there when we checked-out. There were food trays in the hallway all the time which smelled bad when the aromas mixed. I can only assume they retrieve the trays once a day.

Travis the bell man has always taking care of me and my family, he's one of the top Bellman there, I hope they pay him well for all he does, along with Eli ranks right up there with Travis. As far as the hotel it has had a few updates as far as the hallways with new carpet. But the rooms themselves are getting a little outdated, but still comfortable and clean. We've only been in the pool a few times, it seems no matter what time of year we go it's always cold and the pool area and hot tub is outdated. The Starbucks on location is a nice added touch, a little more pricey and they stopped giving free water like all other Starbucks locations- the Disneyland Starbucks with your annual pass discount is cheaper and they give you free water in their cups if you ask. We will continue to stay here as long as they continue to update the location, and the best touch is Travis and Eli the Bellmans."

9552,Anaheim Marriott Suites,Garden Grove,2016-08-10T00:00:00Z,33.78814,-117.916591,3.0,"I booked this room thru Expedia. As Marriott normally does for such reservations, they provide you with a room at the stated rate but that room is, IMHO, the worst of the lot. In my case, I was assigned a wheelchair accessible room which meant that shelves and counterspace were slightly lower than normal. This made things more difficult for me since I stand nearly two meters in height and have a bad back. However, I decided I could tough it out given my late arrival and lack of desire to wander back to the front desk and request a change - which I would probably not be provided. Rather interestingly, I have booked rooms at five hotels in the past two weeks. Marriott was the only chain which provided a room of this sort. As for the hotel, it is quite large and the lobby is well lit. I was not aware of the Marriott Suites concept and was pleased with the size and comfort of the room. However, in the process of checking in and checking out, I found the staff to be both efficient but not that friendly. I also did not appreciate the housekeeping staff banging on my room door at 8:00 in the morning. When I did not answer, the staff proceeded to force her way into the room despite the fact the door was deadbolted and the swinglock engaged. Shame on me for not placing the do not disturb sign out prior to my shower. Thankfully, parking was free but internet was not. Another disappointment. There are lots of hotels in the vicinity. I'll try another on my next trip"

I never heard of a hotel that didn't take credit cards! The so called continental breakfast was unsupervised and there weren't even any lights on in the dining room.

The free breakfast we passed up after the employee sat outside in her stained t-shirt and smoked at the door and we didn't see her wash her hands.

We checked into the hotel, the room was carpet was dirty, the bathroom floor needed to be cleaned.This is an old facility that hasn't been up dated for years, My wife and I will never stay at this hotel and will never book thru Expedia again for motels, I will be going directly to the hotel websites, at least they will be honest with you and not do the prepaid/non refundable/non cancel policy."

Morning breakfast I thought was better than most and even though the hotel is located right off interstate 5 at no time could I hear the traffic our room was second floor at about the middle of the building.

The front desk guy rushed out to greet me, they are always nice that way, and insisted on taking me to see the room when I expressed doubt about the freeway-facing room. They are adding lanes to I-5 and building a new onramp on the gigantic slope which faces the hotel. You can hear the beeping of the machines all day but somewhat muffled if you have the fan ON (not auto). So I guess I can't complain although it is such a horrible noise and you don't want to open the door to the tiny balcony. Breakfast is fine, staff are all pleasant, it just seems expensive at 145 when it's never full that I've ever seen. Beds are fine, even pillows not bad."

As my wife was prep for bed the smell of tobacco started to bother her coming from the desk. She called about the situ and was told that we could move to a handicapped room. Did not want that.

Upon check-in, the front desk had already confused our reservation with someone else's. They blamed it on hotels.com. Then they sent us up to a room with someone already in it- we could hear the tv from the hallway. Went back to the front desk, again blaming it on the hotels.com reservation. They said the reservation number had affected the room number, which is just dumb. Sent down to another room, with 2 queens when the room was booked for a king. Called up to the front desk, they made us come up to get service for yet another room and finally sent us to a king room. Not much to get excited about. The walls were thin and you could hear people through out the night. Breakfast had a wide variety of food, but it was all heat and serve, nothing was cooked fresh. Overall, the hotel was overrated and overpriced. I probably won't be returning to the hotel because they blamed everyone else for their problems."

The only downer was being on the bottom floor you could hear creaks throughout the day and night of people walking around. It had woken me up one morning being so loud.

Also room we were given had an air conditioning unit that was very loud. When we asked the staff if this was normal we were told yes they all pretty much were loud. First night staying there the unit was so loud when it came on that we were woken up multiple times during the wee hours. Asked staff to change rooms next morning and they did switch our room without a problem. The staff was great and there was free breakfast included in the stay, but the breakfast area was crowded with lots of people...So if that bothers you you may want to pass on free breakfast. Also the second room we were given also had problems, still noisy ac unit and also a very noisy bathroom fan. It too was very loud and no I'm not being fussy, it was on its last leg...I think the hotel has some maintenance issues and taking that into consideration it may be a bit too expensive considering.. Also pool was in the worst spot they could have put it...it was right off the lobby making access uncomfortable and not private or a relaxing area at all. The hotel is close to San Clemente Pier/Beach area but not too much around other than that. Again great staff but with the hotel issues we would not stay there again."

The hotel location was convenient being right next to the highway and also being only about 15 minute walk to the beach. We left our car at the hotel our whole stay and walked everywhere. It was easier than finding parking by the beach. Room was clean and beds were very comfortable. Showers were great and always had the right temperature, even after all 4 of us showered. Complimentary breakfast was great and so convenient for my family of 4 and saved us some money eating at the hotel. Hotel property was clean and pretty. There are no views of the beach from our floor level but honestly, we didn't hang at the room expect to sleep and get ready for the days activities so that wasn't a priority to us.

The front reception staff were very friendly and efficient and we were ale to check in to our room early, which was great. The room was very nice, clean and spacious. The beds had choices of soft and firm pillows. The room also had a tea/coffee maker, microwave and bar fridge with freezer which all worked very well.

In the evenings, the front reception filled up the cookie jar with warm chocolate chip cookies straight out of the oven, they were delicious.

This hotel was completely full due to displaced people from Hurricane Matthew and it appeared they were working extra hard to accommodate such a large occupancy.

10049,Sportsmen's Lodge,Studio City,2016-05-27T00:00:00Z,34.144791,-118.41155,3.0,The hotel was great for the price. It was close to Universal Studios. When we first got to the room there was no hot water. They did fix it however. There is also a weird musty smell in the room and throughout the hotel. Even with opening the sliding glass door it did not go away. It's probably because the hotel is so old and there is no exhaust fans in the bathrooms so the steam really gets going in be rooms. The walls and ceilings are paper thin so you can hear every door closing and everything that goes on around you. The hotel has been updated so don't let the hotel so old statement rub you the wrong way. The pool area and hot tub is extremely nice and well kept and the bar and bartender at the pool is a highlight of the property. One last issue is that you have to pay for parking with a hotel stay....ridiculous in my book! Again though for the price of the room it was a good deal and worked for what I needed.

The convenient location was what I enjoyed the most. There were plenty of options for groceries, restaurants, and attractions in the area."
10052,Sportsmen's Lodge,Studio City,2016-04-07T00:00:00Z,34.144791,-118.41155,4.0,"It was ok. Power was out, but that was city wide. The front desk guy was rude."
10053,Sportsmen's Lodge,Studio City,2016-05-31T00:00:00Z,34.144791,-118.41155,3.0,"Hotel is probably over 50 years old and is in need of additional renovation. Pictures don't represent the true condition of the property. Lobby is very nice but the hallways are dingy. The room is huge and very comfortable. Beds are extremely comfortable. Rugs need to be replaced in the hotel and the dcor is in need of a major change. Pool is very nice and is huge. It can be loud - the hotel must book groups but pool view rooms do not have any road noise. The location is terrific. Down the street are a host of great restaurants, salons and a grocery store. Parking is super convenient and is free. Patio food is very expensive but serving size was enough for two."

There was an independent film being shot in the hotel during my stay, which the hotel never mentioned. They used the pool area for two days and a room just down the hall from mine. Noise and working all night. Then the night they left, the fire alarm went off at 2AM. No fire, just pranksters and the alarm staying on for thirty minutes. I didn't enjoy my stay at all and the hallway carpet seemed damp and smelled. There are too many other great hotels in this area to go here again."

10057,Sportsmen's Lodge,Studio City,2016-06-02T00:00:00Z,34.144791,-118.41155,3.0,"This hotel has a large beautiful pool, which is the reason I booked it. My son is recovering from surgery and some of his therapy is done in a swimming pool. As it turned out, our schedule didn't allow him to even use the pool. The property also has lovely grounds with landscaping and fountains, and was in a nice neighborhood for me to take a walk. It is an older property, though, which means noisy elevators, small bathrooms, thin walls, etc. Redocorating doesn't change any of that. We had the wheelchair accessible room with a roll in shower that worked well for my son. There was enough space in the room to include a small refrigerator and microwave but they didn't. I guess they want you to order from room service, but that closes at 9:00 pm. Hello Despite the positives of the property, it really didn't meet our needs and I won't choose to stay there again."
10058,Sportsmen's Lodge,Studio City,2016-04-15T00:00:00Z,34.144791,-118.41155,1.0,We had to move rooms and even then there was no peace. The first night we were kept awake by the pounding drums from their club until 2am. The second night there was a guest screaming in the hall from 2-3am.
10059,Sportsmen's Lodge,Studio City,2016-06-26T00:00:00Z,34.144791,-118.41155,1.0,"Smelled Musty, shower floor had what looked like scabs that we rinsed out, wall by toilet was painted over what looked like buckling mold, beds were comfortable, tv was small and no movie rentals, noisy during day and into night, 70's vibe and perfume smell, they were not accommodating. Shuttle service was ridiculous so he told us take a taxi."

10061,Sportsmen's Lodge,Studio City,2016-04-07T00:00:00Z,34.144791,-118.41155,4.0,"This hotel is really pretty (lots of white/white, pops of orange) The staff are very friendly and despite having a 16 hr power outage the day prior to our arrival, as well as a three hour powder outage during our stay, they did everything in their power to get us checked in and make us comfortable! The food in the small restaurant is delicious as was room service and both reasonably priced. My only complaint would be that we requested a quiet room, but our room was four doors down from the swimming pool entrance. It was very noisy and we were unable to sleep. I would look at this as more of a party hotel and less of a place to rest up for a busy day of sightseeing- just because of the constant hallway noise. Im not sure if there is a quieter place in the hotel since we requested such a room but got assigned to the pool area."
10062,Sportsmen's Lodge,Studio City,2016-06-30T00:00:00Z,34.144791,-118.41155,3.0,"Good stay but disappointed about the pool. Apprently in the summer the hotel sell admission to non guest to use the pool. Due to this myself, my wife and my son couldnt enjoy ammentities we paid for. Rooms are nice and remodeled but you can still see the age of the hotel. First and last time we will be staying there."
10063,Sportsmen's Lodge,Studio City,2016-07-25T00:00:00Z,34.144791,-118.41155,2.0,"Our room was dirty, carpet had so many stains. Toilet took all night to flush. Cafe and restaurant were both closed on a Monday. Place was more like a motel 6. If you have trouble going up stairs to get to your room it's not the place for you. We ordered breakfast and we're told it would be half an hour. One hour later I called asking where breakfast was because the hotel tablet said it had been delivered, the girl on the phone said it hadn't even been started and did we still want it. I said no. 10 minutes later the cafe management came to our room (where there is a do no disturb sign) banging on our door trying to bully us into reordering breakfast because he said they cannot waste food. The food had not been made according to the girl I spoke to. They lied. The place is rundown and they will try and bully you into buying food. You'll probably be better off at a motel 6."
10064,Sportsmen's Lodge,Studio City,2016-07-05T00:00:00Z,34.144791,-118.41155,4.0,"The room was comfortable and very pleasant, overlooking the pool. (The pool was great!) Even tho we were in a very busy city, the surrounding grounds made you feel like you were in a very private and quiet place. I have to say, though, I cannot understand why the hallways were painted pea-soup green. Ugh! And carpeting to match! I guess if you are color blind, then the place is perfect."
10065,Sportsmen's Lodge,Studio City,2016-03-09T00:00:00Z,34.144791,-118.41155,1.0,"The room was noisy ,even though I requested a quiet room. Unfortunately they were unable to move me to a quieter room. I actually changed hotels because of the noise."
10066,Sportsmen's Lodge,Studio City,2016-05-16T00:00:00Z,34.144791,-118.41155,4.0,"The renovations to the hotel are beautiful. The room was very comfortable yet a little dark as far as lighting is concerned. Also, we had NO closet space. There was a very small area, as wide as your carry-on suitcase! No door on the closet area but a curtain which hardly exposed that space so we had to hold the curtain out of the way along with the rod that open and close the curtain while we got our clothes out. The three deep drawers available were helpful but there is plenty of room for a small dresser which would enable the closet to be more efficient."
10067,Sportsmen's Lodge,Studio City,2016-04-12T00:00:00Z,34.144791,-118.41155,4.0,"Went with my son to go to Universal Studios. Location was great. Pool is the BEST!

I only spent a night there, but wow, they've really tried to cover up the old rooms with some flair. They give you a tablet that is only for looking at the hotel's services and there is a fancy mirror in the bathroom, but otherwise the rooms are very sub-par. Way below a typical Holiday Inn. Thank goodness I was on the end, but I still could here whenever anyone would talk in the hallway or shut their door. And the doors slam! Even when you are trying to be gentle. The decor is not great either. Next to the TV, there was just one big wall and a lot of space. It certainly didn't help damper any noise. Maybe hang up some sound-absorbent fabric. The guys at the front desk were good, so I cannot complain about the service. The location is great. The lobby was definitely remodeled to be ULTRA modern. Lot of orange and white. They just need to remodel the rooms and thicken the walls, get new doors, new shower and tubs, new moldings, and then I'd stay there again."

I chose to wait. I went to the Red Rock Cafe during my wait and ate their delicious brunch and took advantage of their bottomless mimosas. It was not even 20 minutes later that I was informed my room was ready. I booked a king guestroom with a city view and it was clean and spacious. The hotel was very prompt with my requests for more towels and an issue with the air conditioner, which was resolved in about only 10 minutes. Overall, my experience was excellent. The pool was fantastic, the service prompt and the employees are very friendly and helpful. I would definitely stay here in the future!"

It has a boutique feel about it, is very laid back, and is also clean and well run. The location is also very good (depending on what you want to see in L.A.) The cafe in the hotel serves excellent breakfasts and lunches, and the food at the River Rock restaurant is awesome. We will definitely stay there again."

They spent all the renovation money on the lobby. The beds are lumpy and soft, the pool view rooms have echoes from the pool and bar area all night long. No elevator in the rooms above the lobby and the dcor is right out of American Horror Story. The carpet looks original and this is an OLD place. No bolts on room doors and the bathrooms are tiny! You can barely turn around when you're at the sink because you'll trip over the toilet. The pool area was supposed to close at 9:00 pm, but we had to call the front desk 3 times to get them to close the pool finally at 11pm."

We are in the process of disputing it. I have tried to call them 3 times and the phone just rings. The last time I called it rang for 11 minutes and then I hung up. Also when checking in they we distracted and gave us no information on the area or hotel. They were busy talking to each other. Last the paint on the tile was pealing in the bathroom. The place is very noisy. Almost like a big party at night. I do not recommend it for families but singles and college age may love it.

Unfortunately, the walls were so thin it was almost impossible to sleep. I'm a heavy sleeper and normally don't have this issue but I could literally hear the ppl next to me , above me and in the halls. Doors would slam, I could hear ppl in their bathrooms and the cleaning ladies were so loud I could hear their full conversations. The whole point of a hotel is to sleep and this isn't the place to do that."

The carpet is worn, and you feel like you're in a hotel from the 60s that is hiding it's bug. They had a wedding that we didn't know about and the music was loud, the after party was loud. Even for the special price. This was the worst hotel I've ever booked on Hotels.com. The towels at the pool were dirty. Needless to say I couldn't wait to leave. Biggest waste of money."

10108,Sportsmen's Lodge,Studio City,2016-04-08T00:00:00Z,34.144791,-118.41155,2.0,"Stay away from this over-priced dump. The designers came up with ill-advised renovations by painting over tired walls floors and the pool deck. This place is beat. Teardown and start over. Loud, stupid and inconsiderate staff. Doors slamming at all hours. Good luck trying to sleep in this historic hotel. Don't be fooled. Bar is a joke too. Weirdest place I've stayed in LA."
10109,Sportsmen's Lodge,Studio City,2016-03-05T00:00:00Z,34.144791,-118.41155,1.0,"I had stayed at the Sportsmen's Lodge 30+ years ago, and was surprised to see the online photos of what looked to be a complete makeover - but don't believe it. It is no more than a tired old motel with some new paint and a few accessories. The air conditioning didn't work, so we had to leave the sliding glass door open all night - first floor on the parking lot, so we slept with one eye open, since the neighborhood is a bit sketchy. We already moved rooms once, and were told that the room we had was the last of it's kind (with 2 queen beds) so we were stuck there. There was dried urine on the floor of the bathroom, and someone else's toothbrushes left on a shelf - I had to trust that they actually changed the sheets, but not sure about that. Finally, one of the guests next door was vomiting on the balcony in the middle of the night - so we finally realized that this is a motel for people who want to party all night - probably good for that, but not much else. Definitely not worth the high price we paid."
10110,Sportsmen's Lodge,Studio City,2016-06-17T00:00:00Z,34.144791,-118.41155,4.0,The food at the Patio Cafe and Riverrock were especially great!
10111,Sportsmen's Lodge,Studio City,2016-07-17T00:00:00Z,34.144791,-118.41155,3.0,"Room was decent, not what's pictured on website. Wifi was horrible. Only provided 2 packets of single serve coffee. One regular, one decaf Save your money, better value at most best westerns."
10112,Sportsmen's Lodge,Studio City,2016-03-08T00:00:00Z,34.144791,-118.41155,4.0,This location was very close to where we were visiting. We were not at the hotel much - the grounds were beautiful and the room was clean. The service was excellent. The bed was comfortable. Walls were thin and we could hear the TV in the next room one morning. Overall the hotel is terrific and I would definitely recommend!
10113,Sportsmen's Lodge,Studio City,2014-12-13T00:00:00Z,34.144791,-118.41155,5.0,"My husband and I chose the Sportsmen's Lodge as our wedding venue because of past experiences. We both had attended events in the past (one wedding, one quicenera) and both were breathtakingly beautiful.Working with Melissa Saldibar and Cynthia Rivera as our coordinators was amazing! These ladies are definitely a dynamic duo and truly are a great representation of the Sportsmen's Lodge. Everyone there was very professional and were always readily available! At times, I felt like I would send so many emails asking questions, but Melissa and Cynthia responded to every one of them so promptly and did not mind. The venue was amazing--my husband and I had the Regency as our reception hall and we married at the North Garden. Even though it was chilly outside, the decorations in the North Garden were so romantic and help set the mood. The reception hall was set-up on time and everything was done to perfection. The staff during the reception were nothing but amazing and always willing to help!Thank you Sportsmen's Lodge and their team for making our wedding truly a dream come true!"
10114,Sportsmen's Lodge,Studio City,2016-07-06T00:00:00Z,34.144791,-118.41155,5.0,"We booked this hotel last minute and had no idea what to expect. I researched it and saw it had a prominent history in California but was nervous on what modern accommodations it had now. The lobby is beautiful and very clean. I felt as though I was in a really high end hotel. The staff was so friendly and helpful with everything. They had no problem taking their time in making sure I knew where to park, what accommodations they had, and how we could get to UNiversal Studios the easiest. Our room was an absolute delight. You could tell they really take care of each room. Our sheets were clean and the bathroom very modern and clean. The only reason I gave it a 4 and not a 5 in cleanliness is because in the shower there was a vent - that possible had a purpose prior to the updated renovations to the hotel - and before we took a shower a big spider crawled out from it. In the morning another spider was found in the shower. The hotel also gave my husband and I a smart tablet in the room at no extra cost to use for the stay that told about restaurants, grocery stores, attractions, and information about the hotel. It was so cool and a great help in finding where we could eat late in the night."
10115,Sportsmen's Lodge,Studio City,2016-07-19T00:00:00Z,34.144791,-118.41155,3.0,The staff were very friendly and helpful. The pea green color in the hallway is aweful and the carpet is just as bad. I think that this hotel was beautiful back in the day but you can tell that it has been renovated. I should of taken a picture of ceiling over tub in bathroom because although it was painted you could see bubbling under it. Paint was peeling off a spot on tile in shower surround. I asked for a refrigerator for our room since in small print I saw you could ask for one for twenty dollars a stay. They dropped off the oldest looking small refrigerator but it did work. Pool area was beautiful and the lobby was too.
10116,Sportsmen's Lodge,Studio City,2016-07-23T00:00:00Z,34.144791,-118.41155,4.0,"Lovely hotel and the staff are fantastic. I called to try for a last minute reservation the morning of my check in. Spoke to by far the nicest man by the name of Howard. He was humorous, helpful and took my phone number down to call and let me know if I could check in early. I did manage to do an earlier check in and the entire front desk crew were incredible. Very lively pool area (loud but fun) and the rooms are delightful. Looks renovated, amazingly comfortable bed, I was on the 5th floor facing a quiet area, cute bathroom, clean and so convenient. Only thing I would have liked is a refrigerator as I'm used to the chains like Marriott and Hampton Inns etc., however, with a foodstore opposite and Starbucks plus other stores, it was no big deal. Will definitely stay there again. Will admit though that the direct rate booking through hotel website was cheaper than Expedia but it was too late, I had used Expedia for this booking."
10117,Sportsmen's Lodge,Studio City,2016-04-06T00:00:00Z,34.144791,-118.41155,2.0,"The location was great. Check in was fast and friendly. Our first night there a transformer exploped in the area we lost power at 9pm and it was not back on by morning, went 2 days with no electricity. The hotel could of provided candles or lanterns to have some light especially at night. Or refunded some of the room fees. The power outage was not the fault of the hotel but they could of provided something for the inconvenience."

10119,Sportsmen's Lodge,Studio City,2016-04-25T00:00:00Z,34.144791,-118.41155,2.0,"For the price I was severely dissapointed. The hotel is old, the only nice room was the lobby. The resteraunt/cafe was closed. There was no microwave or refrigerator in the room. The pool and hot tub were disgusting. The cable is minimal and no option to rent anything. They charge you per day for parking in their decrepit parking lot. The bed was uncomfortable and the pillows were horrible. The bathroom was a joke. I have paid the same price for much nicer hotels. The only good thing about this hotel was how close it is to universal studios. Terrible experience, there was even construction going on in a room a few doors down from me. I will not be staying here again."
10120,Sportsmen's Lodge,Studio City,2016-10-02T00:00:00Z,34.144791,-118.41155,1.0,No refrigerator...a lot of musicians playing music and singing all night and noisy by the pool. Walls peeling..carpet dirty

10122,Sportsmen's Lodge,Studio City,2016-09-27T00:00:00Z,34.144791,-118.41155,2.0,Stay was only okay. Only 1 mile to ABC studio so location was great. Room service was quick and delicious. Room was okay not very sound proof. We could hear the room next door TV until 3 am. Also floor had been rented out to a movie crew. It was difficult to get down the hallway to our room. It was extremely loud. There is a Starbucks across the street but no ther shopping. We were going to see a TV taping so location was great. Would not recommend this hotel unless you need this location. Also a 14 dollar a day parking fee
10123,Sportsmen's Lodge,Studio City,2016-07-22T00:00:00Z,34.144791,-118.41155,5.0,The staff were very kind and helpful. Free shuttle that takes you to Universal Studios was extremely helpful!

10125,Sportsmen's Lodge,Studio City,2016-07-25T00:00:00Z,34.144791,-118.41155,1.0,Service was horrible. Front desk for check in was very rude. Front desk for check out made me wait 30 minutes while they went up to check the room before signing off and returning my deposit to me. Deposit was higher than any 5 star quality resort hotel that I have stayed in!! Room rate was way more money than the hotel quality warranted. The entire hotel needs serious renovations. The Pool and Spa were dirty and needed maintenance. I will never stay at this hotel again.
10126,Sportsmen's Lodge,Studio City,2016-02-20T00:00:00Z,34.144791,-118.41155,1.0,the rooms are ok. beds are extremely comfortable. don't use their towels unless you want white fuzz in your hair! good lodge overall. non smoking rooms.

10128,Sportsmen's Lodge,Studio City,2016-07-21T00:00:00Z,34.144791,-118.41155,3.0,There is no elevator in or near the lobby. My second floor room near the pool was very noisy making rest in the afternoon impossible. Many of the staff had poor command of the English language. The printer in the business center was out of toner for two days.
10129,Sportsmen's Lodge,Studio City,2016-08-30T00:00:00Z,34.144791,-118.41155,3.0,The hotel smelled like chlorine from the pool and was damp and musty. The free wi-fi was inconsistent. The hotel staff was adequate but the shuttle service to the Universal Studios was convenient.
10130,Sportsmen's Lodge,Studio City,2016-01-13T00:00:00Z,34.144791,-118.41155,5.0,"Love this hotel good size room ,great location and good size balconies has a template to order ur room service and clean towels. And best part great price for what ur getting."
10131,Sportsmen's Lodge,Studio City,2016-10-22T00:00:00Z,34.144791,-118.41155,4.0,"The hotel has clearly been recently remodeled. There are still touches of 70's style, but everything is clean and the things that you want to be new are. The thing to note is that this is a party hotel. There is an event center on the property, and that's why I stayed there, and others had the same idea. There is loud music playing nearly all day, although blissfully not in the late night or early morning. It's a fine place to stay as a home base, but not if you are looking for quiet or romance."
10132,Sportsmen's Lodge,Studio City,2015-04-15T00:00:00Z,34.144791,-118.41155,4.0,The French toast is killer.

The only thing that i think needs improvement is the shuttle bus service which can include more places other than universal studios and at more frequent times."

10140,Sportsmen's Lodge,Studio City,2016-09-16T00:00:00Z,34.144791,-118.41155,2.0,"They hold parties downstairs. So if you want any sleep, don't stay here. Music was so loud called front desk to complain but that fell on deaf ears. Hotel is a bit outdated. No refrigerator or microwave in rooms. But the room were clean and the grounds are nice."
10141,Sportsmen's Lodge,Studio City,2016-09-16T00:00:00Z,34.144791,-118.41155,1.0,"When we arrived to the room our beds were not queen sizes. I been to many hotels and I know what a queen bed size is. These beds were double sizes. We also selected for city view. As you can see in the photo I posted this is not city view. It was a view of trees and the parking lot. We contacted the front desk and spoke to the supervisor Faustino who gave the worse customer service.He said yes I can see how our website can be misleading. He said they can upgrade if we pay for it. REALLY!!! We asked for a roll out bed since the beds were small we wouldn't fit comfortably and he said no they can't because we already have two beds in the room. They brought us sheets so one of us had to sleep on the floor. The room had hair all on the bathroom walls, cracks in walls were just painted over, and sheets had stains. When we reserved for the shuttle the lady in the front desk advised us to meet in the front at 3:10pm and the driver will take us. We arrived on time in the front and we waited and waited eventually I went inside to advise them we're still waiting. It was Faustino who was at the front desk and he told me well it's a complimentary shuttle it's not guaranteed. I advised him we spoke to the lady earlier that day who took the information down for our reservation and she gave it to the driver and how can you ensure a customer of this service, we follow the directions given and than tell us it's not guaranteed. This is wasting a customers time. This was the worse stay and serv"

Needs to stop selling room as City View it was a parking lot and a desolate looking buildings. There were stair everywhere so how do wheelchairs maneuver Picking up your suitcase instead of being able to roll it s not cool, but the employees are the bomb.com! They seem to be able to anticipate your struggle and assist. The guests were very friendly, the crowd the pool came to party and they did -awesome! . Lastly, but most importantly, THE FOOD! Both restaurants were EXCELLENT. We got there Happy Hour - so we could not ask for a better time the bar. The water pressure and shower was great!"

Free breakfast was excellent. Pool area was decent. No bar/lounge but they made up for it with 3 free drinks during happy hour.

10177,Drury Inn and Suites Columbus Convention Center,Columbus,2015-09-26T00:00:00Z,39.969219,-82.999881,4.0,"Clean, great neighborhood, great service. I marked off for comfort because the pillows were especially small beyond the point of being uncomfortable, and I'm not especially picky when it comes to sleeping conditions. That said, the breakfast was good, staff was helpful and friendly, and everything was clean. We stayed there to see a show and basically just slept there and ate and left in the morning, but really no complaints. Would recommend to anyone."
10178,Drury Inn and Suites Columbus Convention Center,Columbus,2015-09-20T00:00:00Z,39.969219,-82.999881,4.0,"The free breakfast and the Kickback in the evening are lovely benefits. Appreciating that the kitchen likely does not have a grill, I'd love to see thick ham slices or microwaved bacon along with the pallid gray, limp sausage patties and maybe a more whole grain bread. A little fresh cut up fruit, maybe chopped walnuts along with plain low fat Greek yogurt would be other nice additions to breakfast, and maybe cinnamon or cooked apples to accompany the oatmeal. I'll be coming back to the hotel every two or three months."

The breakfast was very good selection of items and the free drinks and food provided in the evening was added bonus. It wasn't anything fancy but nice to get a quick bite and relax in our room, especially when it's bitter cold out. Wish checkout was noon instead of 11."

My only suggestion would be to have more of a variety for breakfast and dinner which includes more healthier options. I stayed here for three days. By the third day the same thing for breakfast was getting very boring. Also, dinner was exactly the same Monday and Wednesday. My option were further limited by my low-carb diet. It was still definitely nice and worth it for the price."

Our stays have always been comfortable and we will continue to come back. I have to commend the job from your Asst. Manager Richard S., he was helpful and attentive to both us and whoever I saw him dealing with. On top of that, all the staff we encountered.., greeted us or were over polite in allowing to pass or gain access to wherever we were headed. Definitely a 5 star staff.... Next visit to Columbus, we will surely stay there again. The only issue we had was dealing with elevator wait time..., but since our legs work just fine.. I don't mind stairs. God Bless"

Food options were poor, especially in comparison to the Drury we first tried in St. Louis. We paid 50 a night over the Hyatt for the convince of hot breakfast which was foolish, knowing I pack my own food and my son thought the eggs were plastic like. Hot food in the evening included hot dogs and chili."

Hot food was barely warm, coffee was awful, they kept running out of cream, yogurt, and juice. The evening reception was equally unappetizing: the free alcoholic beverages tasted so bad they were undrinkable, and the food was disgusting, cold, and the same offerings each night. The other amenities such as the fitness center and pool were acceptable. But none of this justifies the price of nearly 185 a night."

The bathroom was especially clean. I get grossed out easily and nothing here grossed me out (I didn't even wear my flip flops in the shower). We ended up staying in two different Drury Inns over the weekend. This was our choice as the hot tub was out of order in the first hotel and we really wanted to spend the evening in a hot tub. The first night we stayed at the Drury Inn in Grove City which was a 10-15 minute drive. That hotel was recently remodeled, so the rooms there were fresh looking and had a new feel to them. The Drury Inn downtown had the same great layout, but was just older. Both places had free popcorn and soda, a free happy hour (get the wine), and served free food throughout the day, which helps you save a little on food during your stay."

Called ahead because a group of friends was already there and the room was under my name. The lady at the desk gave them a parking pass and let them go on to the convention we were in town for and we arrived later to a huge clean room. The access to the convention center was great and I will definitely be staying there again next year for the same convention.

The only complaint I have is that the room smelled of smoke. Since neither of us smoke AND the hotel is supposed to be completely smoke-free, that wasn't pleasant (thank goodness, we always bring a can of febreeze). Thankfully, it wasn't over-powering. They did offer to come check it out, but I was more concerned with not getting charged for smoking in the room, which is why I brought it up to the front desk staff. The breakfast is nice and the evening kickback (baked potatoes, nachos, hot dogs, soups, salad, etc.) is nice, too. It's all free and it's good. The room was comfortable and it was quite large. We had a coupon for a free upgrade, otherwise, I'm sure the room wouldn't have been nearly so large. The view of downtown Columbus was great! We took quite a few pictures as the sun was setting and the buildings were lighting up. We definitely felt safe walking around. I would stay here again."

I am a school teacher who took four students on a school trip. The kids had a limited budget. To our surprise this hotel offered both free breakfast and a great supper at night for free.

There's no bar there's no food they say they have free food for gas but really it's just popcorn there's no real amenities this place is so run down joke that hasn't been updated in quite a while. I will never stay here again nor will I stay anywhere but a name brand Hotel since the staff is rude there were no amenities that I'm used to and checking it was an absolute nightmare

The rooms don't have a refrigerator. The lobby closes early for security reasons. The place is close to a number of Sonoma Valley wineries in Healdsburg and Geyserville and elsewhere. It is reasonably close to Napa Valley as well. Rohnert Park also has one of the few Planet Fitness facilities in the area if you care to work out. When I needed quarters for THEIR own coin operated laundry I had to leave to obtain change. The nearby gas station only parted with 2 in quarters when I needed 5: For soap (1) the washing machine (2) and the dryer (2). Convenient it was not."

They did provide shampoo, a continental breakfast, and even a pool. The hotel backs up to the freeway, so the noise in those outside rooms was awful. They provided earplugs, which isn't helpful if you need to hear your alarm. I think if you get an inside courtyard room, you'll be fine and happy you saved a ton of money."

The lobby is closed at night with only a small bank teller window to interact with the front desk staff. The parking lot had lots of trash from fast food restaurants next door. My room's metal door was kicked and dented so badly that it had a huge gap at the bottom through which daylight, and noise passed. The bed was rock hard. The carpet was dirty. The room smelled of stale smoke even though it was supposedly a non-smoking room. The shower head was underwhelming and too low for a man of average height. The elevator interior is just plywood and creaked as the elevator ascended. This motel offers no amenities other than a single bar of soap and a single bottle of shampoo. The motel is in the process of replacing room carpets. There was debris piled everywhere. Construction noise started at 7:30 a.m. each day."

Noise from freeway was present, thin walls/floors. Exterior doors so you hear other patrons entering their rooms, doors closing, etc. Kept the AC/Htr fan on all night to provide 'white' noise. Very nice front desk personnel."

Ironing board and fridge in room but no coffee maker. Coffee available in lobby. There's a pool which is nice to cool off however it overlooks a gas station so not very romantic. Would stay again. It's good enough for a one night stay.

The windows are single pane and thus you can hear everything outside. The hotel is behind a Burger King and Taco Bell, thus you get to hear everyone drive through their drive-thrus all night long. The staff didn't seem to care about anything. The faucet leaked. The TV is in SD and not HD and some of the channels didn't even come in. Overall, I couldn't wait to check out."

I had to stand out in the cold and wait till someone else came to check me in. Then that process a bit unorganized and the girl didn't give me my driver's license back and i didn't know it till the next morning at check out. and I only found out then because instead of leaving the keys in the room like I usually do I decided to go to the lobby and check out. They gave me my license then."

Great location, comfy beds all you could want when you are just needing a place to crash. Just a heads up if you are not facing the pool, you may want to bring a small fan if you are a light sleeper as the location is convient to everything, it does have the travel noise as well."

The only good thing was the front desk staff and the cleanliness of the room. The front desk staff were very nice and efficient. But the room was overpriced for the value. There is free wifi and parking. There was no breakfast included. There were no amenities in the room except for one tiny bottle of shampoo. The mattress was hard as a rock I woke up with a sore back each morning. The neighborhood is sketchy and VERY loud. Police were stopping people all the time. The other guests were very loud.

10456,Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,Rohnert Park,2016-07-20T00:00:00Z,38.3636,-122.71498,3.0,"We stayed for 6 nights. Mostly because of the price and location. We visited Sonoma and Napa primarily and had about a 30-40 minute drive to each. There are also some good breweries within 10 miles. Our favorite was the Cooperage Brewery. PROS Good Location. I got a courtyard room and it was quiet. The bathroom was also clean. Make sure you get a Courtyard Room if you don't want to hear traffic noise all night like I read in other reviews. CONS The carpets needs to be cleaned! After taking my shoes and walking around in the room, I stepped on the towel in the bathroom and my foot left black marks on the towel. Even after showering and washing my feet I would walk barefoot on the carpeted floor and then step on the towel again and black marks again. The bed was a bit hard and small. We reserved a queen but I think they put us in a double. Or somehow my queen bed at home is bigger. The shower head limited the water pressure which made it difficult to rinse all the soap off and it made my Wife's showers take forever to get her hair washed. I think I'm going to start bringing a shower head and a wrench when I travel. I live in California so our shower heads are already limited. But the hotels go too far. The bathroom towels felt like sand paper, where VERY scratchy, and very small. We ended up just using our beach towels that we had brought."

10458,Good Nite Inn Rohnert Park,Rohnert Park,2016-08-06T00:00:00Z,38.3636,-122.71498,2.0,"If you only need a place to sleep and you're traveling with a child or by yourself, then it is adequate. I went with my husband to participate in a race the next day, and I didn't get any sleep. The bed was more of a full than a queen and I kept getting woken up every time my husband moved. The room guests next door entered their room so late, and they were slamming doors and talking very loud and one could hear everything. In the early morning, I was trying to take a shower and the shower head was all messed up, so the water accumulated into a puddle outside of the tub and I had to use my towel to soak it up. We had to share a hand towel, also."

Lighting in the room was very poor and the set up was not conducive to doing any work. The area was pretty safe overall, and I had no trouble walking to and from my client site in Cambridge. But it wasnt very attractive. Also, beware of the free parking. It really is only about 6 spots near the hotel... the rest is in an overflow across the street that is a little difficult and sketchy to navigate as a woman on her own in the evening."

I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone needing to stay in that area.

We love to get to the downtown attractions of the city, but we also have family outside of town. The location made it easy to get on the highway out of town and also get to downtown. We arrived very late, and our room was all ready for us, including having a crib set up for our 6-month old daughter. The staff was great. The room was large enough for the 3 of us and the crib. The temperature was perfect. The room had a microwave and refrigerator. There were a couple cons about the experience. The exhaust fan in the bathroom was hanging off the ceiling when we arrived. It was fixed during our stay. Also, the breakfast choices her limited our last day. The staff member I spoke with explained that their grocery order had not been received as expected.

One elevator was not operating when we got there and during the stay the 2nd elevator stopped working. We had to use the stairs to go up to the 5th floor. They did fix it the same day.

The breakfast was adequate for a complimentary breakfast, but nothing special. It's a short walk from a T station, which is key to access to downtown. It's only three to four stops for all the downtown historic areas. Also nearby is a grocery store in case you're interested in stocking the fridge with snacks. The hotel has free parking and we didn't have a problem finding a space. The neighborhood is somewhat shabby, but the price is less than other hotels in nicer neighborhoods - you get what you pay for."

I contacted Elk Spring Resort and was told not to buy one from them but go directly and buy from Elks Spring (which we did)...we were told the offering (249) did not cover the cleaning fee (which was an additional 250+ fee) We provided a credit card and paid for the rental cabin. Our first night there we discovered that we had an infestation of vermin in the cottage. One actually ran across my face in the middle of the night. We were up all night fighting the vermin. We called customer service the next morning. When they arrived they told us this does not happen at their cabins. We found the nest of vermin. Were told to go into the city and they would get their gun and shoot them. I called the office and asked that we be moved. We were told that they did not have another cabin like the one we had paid for so they moved us next door. We were told that they quarantined our original cabin for several days. I called repeatedly and received no answer and no call back. After the 7th or 8th call I did get hold of a reprehensive who told me that they would refund one night (minus the 250+ cleaning fee). I asked to speak to the manger I was told that this would not happen and this was over. I don't think it is unreasonable to have an expectation when you pay 500.00 for two days to have a clean cabin. Can you imagine staying at a hotel...having a room full of vermin and being told that they would come in an shoot them...oh and have to pay a cleaning fee

10767,Elk Springs Resort,Gatlinburg,2016-06-08T00:00:00Z,35.754868,-83.457295,4.0,We really enjoyed our stay. The accommodations were very clean. The beds were super comfy after a very long day. It has all the amenities of your own home. The location was super convenient to downtown Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge. I liked the master bedroom was separately upstairs from the guest area and game room downstairs.

From the moment I booked the cabin the management staff kept me apprised usually on a weekly basis regarding check in procedures, directions to the cabin, things to do around the area and even called the day of check in to tell us our cabin was ready early and give us our code to enter the cabin. We absolutely loved our three day stay and next time will be extending it for two additional days. Carolyn H"

A few tips: the road up to the cabin was very steep. Our van did fine but we did not have heavy rain or snow. The cabins are somewhat tight together but not more than a normal neighborhood. You are not completely remote but you can... More

10782,Elk Springs Resort,Gatlinburg,2015-11-03T00:00:00Z,35.754868,-83.457295,5.0,"My husband and I stayed at Tree Tops which is in Bearfoot Resort, but managed by Elk Springs Resort. Up until our stay, I received emails to keep me posted on the status of our reservation. I also received a phone call to confirm before Elk Springs charged my credit card for the remainder of our fees. Everyone I spoke to was extremely courteous and professional. The day of our arrival, we received a phone call to let us know the cabin was clean and ready for our arrival, along with information about the door and security codes. After mentioning that our arrival would be well after dark, we arrived at the cabin to find the porch light and most of the interior lights were left on for us. The cabin was absolutely adorable. The two large flat screen televisions were awesome for watching Saturday's games. The kitchen had not only the basics, but good quality cookware and every small appliance we could possibly need to cook meals during our stay. The best part was the views from the two covered porches. Whether grilling out, rocking in the gliders or eating a meal on the upper level porch, the views of Mt. LeConte were breathtaking! On the lower level, we could enjoy the view from the hot tub or swing, which were my personal favorites! This cabin was a little more expensive than some we've stayed in previously, but it was by far the nicest. We agreed that we will definitely be contacting Elk Springs next time we visit the Smokies!"
