One of the most important things about Streamlit apps is that they can take and react to user input.

There are a huge range of input types available - but let's start with a simple one.

Let's create a drop-down select box with a couple of options.

The function we need is `st.selectbox()`.

We first pass in a label that will be displayed to the user so they know what the input is for.

We then pass in a list of possible options as a list (square brackets) or a tuple (curved brackets).

We assign the output of `st.selectbox()` to a variable.

We can then use `st.write()` to print out a string that includes the selected option from our list of options.

We've also got a dictionary of links to the posters for each of these movies -

```{python}
#| eval: false
import streamlit as st

chosen_option = st.selectbox(
    "What is your favourite movie?",
    ["Back to the Future", "Home Alone", "Bicentennial Man"],
)

st.write(f"You selected: {chosen_option}")

image_url = {
    "Back to the Future": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d2/Back_to_the_Future.jpg",
    "Home Alone": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/76/Home_alone_poster.jpg",
    "Bicentennial Man": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fc/Bicentennial_man_film_poster.jpg"
    }

st.image(image_url[chosen_option])
```

Try it out in the interactive version of the app below.

See how the value changes?

```{stlite-python}
import streamlit as st

chosen_option = st.selectbox(
    "What is your favourite movie?",
    ["Back to the Future", "Home Alone", "Bicentennial Man"],
)

st.write("You selected:", chosen_option)

image_url = {"Back to the Future": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d2/Back_to_the_Future.jpg",
            "Home Alone": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/76/Home_alone_poster.jpg",
            "Bicentennial Man": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fc/Bicentennial_man_film_poster.jpg"}

st.image(image_url[chosen_option])
```

## Streamlit Running Order

A key concept of Streamlit is that each time something changes, the app reruns from top to bottom.

This is a good thing for simple apps - but it can become problematic as your app becomes more complex and if you have things that take longer to rerun.

Let's make a new app that takes some different inputs.

:::{.callout-note}
Here we artifically induce a wait for the loading phase so you can more clearly see the process by which the app reruns.

You don't need to do this in your own apps! They will just run as fast as the code possibly can - but that can still not be fast enough if there are lots of things that need to be recalculated.

Here, despite the fact that the dataframe does not change between runs

```{python}
#| eval: false
import streamlit as st
import time
import pandas as pd

st.write("Loading the name popularity lookup")
time.sleep(3)
st.write("Still Loading...")
time.sleep(3)

url = 'https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/yxrc1ll9o3kpg5b1ekm5b/girl_boy_names_2022.csv?rlkey=eq3uv3ms5441gqxchnnom1h6b&st=d53l3q1q&dl=1'
name_lookup = pd.read_csv(url)
st.write("Done!")

input_name = st.text_input("What is your name?")

boy_name_lookup = name_lookup[name_lookup["Boy Name"] == input_name]
girl_name_lookup = name_lookup[name_lookup["Girl Name"] == input_name]

if len(boy_name_lookup) > 0:
    st.write(f"{input_name} was in popularity position {boy_name_lookup["Rank"].values[0]} for boys in 2022.")
else:
    st.write(f"{input_name} was not in the most popular 1000 names for boys in 2022.")

if len(girl_name_lookup) > 0:
    st.write(f"{input_name} was in popularity position {girl_name_lookup["Rank"].values[0]} for girls in 2022.")
else:
    st.write(f"{input_name} was not in the most popular 1000 names for girls in 2022.")

```

```{stlite-python}
# stlite quirks mean we need (in reality) to use await asyncio.sleep instead of time.sleep
# and we also need to point towards a different file upload service as google drive, dropbox and
# github raw file storage all return errors when trying to access valid files via the stlite
# interface
import streamlit as st
import asyncio
import pandas as pd

st.write("Loading the name popularity lookup")
await asyncio.sleep(3)
st.write("Still Loading...")
await asyncio.sleep(3)

url = 'https://files.catbox.moe/16k7td.csv'
name_lookup = pd.read_csv(url)
st.write("Done!")

input_name = st.text_input("What is your name?")

boy_name_lookup = name_lookup[name_lookup["Boy Name"] == input_name]
girl_name_lookup = name_lookup[name_lookup["Girl Name"] == input_name]

if len(boy_name_lookup) > 0:
    st.write(f"{input_name} was in popularity position {boy_name_lookup["Rank"].values[0]} for boys in 2022.")
else:
    st.write(f"{input_name} was not in the most popular 1000 names for boys in 2022.")

if len(girl_name_lookup) > 0:
    st.write(f"{input_name} was in popularity position {girl_name_lookup["Rank"].values[0]} for girls in 2022.")
else:
    st.write(f"{input_name} was not in the most popular 1000 names for girls in 2022.")

```


:::{.callout-tip}
There are some more advanced features of Streamlit you can call upon when you want to minimize the number of code reruns that occur unnecessarily.

We'll cover these - such as caching, partial reruns, activation buttons and session state - later in the book.

For now, it's just important to be aware that a Streamlit app behaves a lot like a Python script - it's almost like a frontend that reruns a script each time an input value is changed.

This design decision keeps the code as simple as possible - and it's often not a big problem for simpler apps.

Still, you will need to keep it in mind as your apps grow in complexity.
